10,dydu1ld,8gqw9r,t5_3f8vd,2,AutomateAllThings,,False,t1_dydu1ld,"The Senate has signed a contract with a new payroll administrator for more than $902,000 over five years, taking a substantial step in ditching the problem\-plagued Phoenix pay system.

Ontario Liberal Senator Jim Munson \(Ottawa\-Rideau Canal\), a deputy chair of the powerful Senate Internal Economy, Budgets, and Administration Committee, broke the news Wednesday at a media availability in the Senate foyer. The committee makes decisions about the Chamber's financial and legal affairs. He said that about 200 of the 700 Senate employees have been affected per year by overpayments or underpayments since the Senate moved to the Phoenix pay system in April 2016.

""We want to make sure that our employees are valued. And when you show up to work, you expect a paycheque. So in the Senate of Canada it's not different. And the reason we could do it is because we're an autonomous institution,"" he said. ""We recognize there was a major problem and we're confident that this will alleviate some of the financial stresses and strains.

""The contract was signed April 26 with ADP Canada, and is worth $902,250 over five years, said Senate spokesperson Alison Korn in an emailed statement. The first\-year cost is $171,650, with an annual increase of 2.5 per cent \(so the fifth\-year cost is $189,470\), as well as a one\-time implementation cost of $25,000.ADP Canada, a human resources firm based in Toronto, was chosen because it has the expertise to do the work in a timely manner, has a proven track record of customer satisfaction, successful on\-time and on\-budget implementation, responsive and effective technical support, and is financially sound, said Ms. Korn.

ADP pays one in four Canadians in the private sector, according to information on its website.Being a bilingual company, it seemed to fit the unique needs of the Senate, said Sen. Munson. He said the Senate hopes to have the new system in place by the fall, but Ms. Korn said it's too early to give an exact date.

As for next steps, Ms. Korn said, ""the Senate and ADP Canada are developing a timeline and action plan for importing payroll data as well as for the design, testing, and implementation of the new payroll system.

""The Phoenix pay system went live in two waves in February and April 2016, and since then has left about 75 per cent of federal government workers underpaid, overpaid, or not paid at all. The project had two parts: to use off\-the\-shelf software configured to the government's human resources systems, dubbed Phoenix, to pay employees; and to centralize the compensation advisers for 46 government departments and agencies at the Public Service Pay Centre in Miramichi, N.B.

The 55 other departments and entities\-including the Senate and the House of Commons\-have their own in\-house compensation advisers. Senators are not paid by the Phoenix system, so only staff experienced problems.

Examples of issues experienced include that Phoenix does not consistently pay vacation pay accurately; it does not calculate some retroactive payments correctly; and it pays overtime rates for casual workers who work additional hours at a single rate, therefore needing manual correction for each pay.In June, the Senate started down the road of ditching Phoenix when it issued a request for information from potential service providers before considering a call for proposals, to get more information on the payroll outsourcing services available on the market.

In October, it posted a request for proposals on the government's procurement website seeking a company to ""assume responsibility for payroll processing...for all employees of the Senate of Canada."" The request for proposals closed Nov. 30, and Sen. Munson said there were seven interested bidders.

The bidders were evaluated on a number of criteria, said Ms. Korn, including their payroll solutions and services, their call centre, their employee self\-service portal, their payroll administrator portal, and their security, privacy, and confidentiality.

Sen. Munson said he empathizes with those affected by Phoenix, noting ""it's caused hardship, undue hardship, and it's unfair.""He said the Senate switched because it had the ability to do so, being autonomous from the government. Unfortunately, that's not really possible for government departments, he said, so ""obviously the sooner... the government of Canada fixes this, the better.""

""The government hasn't given a timeline to fix Phoenix, which has cost taxpayers more than $1\-billion, but in the last budget it announced $16\-million for the Treasury Board to start looking for its replacement. ",True,,1525387729.0,1525358929.0,,t3_8gqw9r,t3_8gqw9r,2,0,0

Well I inherited the problem when I took the position and decided to do something about it. I realized that the employee clearly had mental health issues, like serious issues, but I was told by labour relations that we could not force her to consult (and I of course cannot make a diagnostic!). After a while when she noticed I wasn't going to let it go, she managed to get a long-term sick leave and when she came back months later, and I was still there (I was in an acting position that kept getting renewed) the grievances and harassement complains started. It was so bad that even the union took my side... informally after meeting with labour relations they said there wasn't much anyone could do.

In the end, senior management decided to move her away from me as if I was the problem instead of supporting me to finish the job (or force her to get the help she needed).

Without that protection, you will get stomped on by others who feel threatened by your initiative.

Many shy away from that duty, preferring saying flattering things or agreeing with the powerful in the hopes of favours. But some come to the table armed with binders full of facts and speak anyway.

* You are simultaneously expected to produce perfect work, preferably the first time, in both official languages, without making anybody angry, while at the same time being portrayed in the press as a lazy good-for-nothing who gets too many vacation days and smoke breaks.  Oh, and if you're competent and energetic at work, you will invariably end up doing the work of at least two people.  And you will at least once in your career go searching for second-hand office supplies because that's all that's left in the supply cabinet, or have to make your own notepads out of single-sided printed paper out of the recycle bin. But remember, in the public's eyes, you're a lazy, grasping leech on the public treasury. You have to be OK with this dichotomy.

* There are some amazing files to work on, and there is thankless drudgery, and sometimes the difference between the two is the attitude of the employee tasked with doing it.

- Respecting hierarchy and policies: there is nothing wrong with that rigidity. The problem comes when making a change is too hard. You will see, you will love people that adhere to guidelines and whatnot rigidly - otherwise it means you are stuck with assclowns who either do not understand their job or don't care enough.

- Moving up is as hard and as easy as people make it sound. It is not true that you need a powerful friend to move up - like anywhere else it is not a bad thing though. If you are good, not an asshole to others and APPLY TO GET PROMOTIONS, you will move up (this is key, people think that ""oh it's been five years at a certain level, I am due for a promotion""...NOPE!)

- It is dog eat dog, like any other places where moving up means big bucks. Just don't pay attention to them and remain professional, excel and apply. You will move up while those grudgy people will remain at the same level.

- Do no listen to people complaining about their work or workplace. Most people I know hate their work or workplace, even if they chose the work and love the work...

As to your question about union dues - chances are you're represented by the Union of Taxation Employees (https://www.ute-sei.org/en/about). It's a component of the Public Service Alliance of Canada (www.psacunion.ca). As they noted, you do *not* need to join the union unless you want to do so. You're obligated to pay union dues either way, and the union is obligated to represent you either way. This is known as the ""Rand Formula"". Details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_formula

The exact amount of union dues with PSAC is tricky, because it's calculated as a percentage of salary, with portions going to PSAC, to the component (UTE) and to the local union. Either way, the union should be able to tell you how much those percentages are if you ask.

Most paid leave (vacation, personal leave days, family-related leave, etc, along with unpaid leave like maternity/parental) will be covered by your collective agreement: https://www.ute-sei.org/en/bargaining/current-collective-agreement.

The priority ""list"" is actually a database of people who have a priority status under either the Public Service Employment Act or the Public Service Employment Regulations. There are a number of reasons that people might have a priority status, but the bottom line is that those people *must* be hired ahead of anybody else to any position where they are both interested and qualified. HR has to query the priority system and notify any potentially-interested persons, and those people have a chance to say whether they're interested or not. If they're interested, then the manager has to assess them to decide if they are qualified. The process of checking the priority list and verifying that no priorities are interested or qualified is known as the ""priority clearance"" process. It can take as little as two days (if there are no priorities who match in the system when the request is made) to several weeks (if multiple priority persons indicate interest and need to be assessed). 

Priority clearance is a mandatory requirement for virtually all term or indeterminate hiring processes. Until the system has been checked, neither HR nor your manager will know how long the clearance process will take. There may also be other approval/paperwork steps involved that could delay the process.

174,dy2nhjt,8fdl6i,t5_3f8vd,21,mainland_infiltrator,Department of Regional Incentive Targets (moderator/modérateur),False,t1_dy2nhjt,"A few reasons why managers do this:

**Thing One**: Especially for people coming *to* the NCR, it's not at all uncommon for people to accept a job mostly just to get relocated. They join Department A, and Department A foots the bill for their relocation, and they get all set up and situated, and four months later they deploy to Department B, and that's that: Department A gets stuck paying the full relocation, but Department B gets the employee.

**Thing Two**: Relocations are expensive. Even Directors General will generally be unable to pony up for more than one or two a year before they need to find additional money. Which is to say that they're okay using them to bring in a sure-thing unicorn at a fairly high level, but persuading them to take a chance on an early-career person is a big lift.

**Thing Three**: Leaving a competition open to all Canadians means you get a lot of people who (1) aren't qualified for the job, (2) aren't interested in the job, (3) are applying for every job on the site regardless of points 1 and 2, and (4) would not accept the job if offered. Trawling through all this dross is not a good use of your time, even if there are a few gems in there. (I mean, let's be real: there's no shortage of external candidates qualified to take on, say, an AS-02. Do you really need to consider every single one of them across the country, or can you just pick from the thousands who already live in Ottawa?)

**Thing Four**: Relocations are slow and risky. Adding a relocation will reliably add between 4 and 12 weeks to the staffing process, and that's 4 to 12 weeks of needing to constantly monitor and update and track the situation -- and even then, the employee can change their mind right up until the very last minute.

Maybe she gets a better job elsewhere. Maybe she can't find a school she deems acceptable for her children. Maybe she decides she just doesn't want to live this far away from an aging parent. Maybe her partner puts the kibosh on it. Maybe she gets to Ottawa and discovers that big cities are big and scary and intimidating and that she'd rather stay in Grover's Corners, where the grass is sweet and the people are nice and the trolleys only cost a nickel. Doesn't matter: she's got wide latitude to cancel at any time.

Conversely, if you pick someone who already lives in Ottawa, you won't be in for any surprises on this front. They already live here. They already know where your offices are. They can start as soon as you get a Letter of Offer spun up.

GCconnex is 10 years old. It started, in part, because FB was simply not allowed on GC networks back then and we wanted to provide employees with a place to connect. Is it still a necessary forum/tool? I like to think so even if the raison d'être isn't the same. Has the GCtools engagement team performed better than described? I do think so too also.

On the OG's recommendations:  it looks to me as no.1 will be happening naturally (shifting priorities, $ availability, TBS desire to ""show the thing/build the thing""). On no.2, it's tougher...

I'm all for frank discussions and typically jump right in them (like in this one). I'm using the same handle over multiple platforms and have no issues with people linking back my opinions to my identify (not a critique or anything about people who prefer anonymity, that's just how I approach things). All of this being said, a lot of people just take things too damn seriously and are afraid to make bold/frank statements, thinking it might affect their ""personal brand"" or might limit their career progression. Even if GCtools went forward and pushed for a ""be uncomfortably frank"" stance on GCconnex, some users will only stay on the safe side of the line, and/or user the tool to self-promote. GCconnex is both a tool and a community. The tool isn't perfect, but on it's own, it can't make the community ""better""...

On the reply about GCconnex being a tool for HQ employees by HQ employees, I tempted to say that I agree (at least in part). We need to build more use cases that will make GCtools useful to more people. If we can't make it useful beyond the Downtown  Ottawa-Gatineau bubble, the relevance of any tool (GCtools or not) is awfully limited.

This is slightly different from *dual employment* which occurs when an employee accepts a term position while on LWOP from an indeterminate position. With dual employment, you only actively get paid in one position (the term position) 

As to pay and administration, its much less common to be hired into a dual remuneration situation than to do a transfer between departments and it can make administering things like paid leave more complex. With dual remuneration each position is treated as an independent job, so you cant (for example) use banked sick leave from your first job to take time off from your second job - for the second job you would start as if you were an external hire with no banked leave credits.

If you take the second job and then later resign from the first job, Im not sure if you can at that point transfer over things like banked vacation and sick leave.

**Appendix F**

**Memorandum of Understanding Between the Treasury Board of Canada and the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada With Respect to Occupational Group Structure Review and Classification Reform**

This memorandum is to give effect to the agreement reached between the Employer and the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada (PIPSC) in respect of employees in the Computer Systems (CS) bargaining unit. The Employer is committed to engaging in meaningful consultation with the PIPSC with respect to the review of the CS occupational group, followed by meaningful consultation regarding Classification Reform.
Meaningful consultation on Classification Reform will include consultation on the development of a standard which reflects and measures, in a gender neutral manner, elements including skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions of work performed by CS employees.

The review of the CS group falls within the broader context of the Occupational Group Structure (OGS) Review. Consultation and work on the CS occupational group review, including developing an implementation strategy, will be completed by December 2019.
The agreement cannot be interpreted as a relinquishment of management rights over classification or as a guarantee that a consensus can be reached on any of the outcomes of the consultation themselves.

**Leave with Income Averaging**: plan to take a big chunk of time off, and reduce your pay accordingly -- but you continue to be paid during your leave.

Suppose you make a nice, tidy $100,000 per year. You decide you want to take the whole months of June, July and August off in order to go on a cycling holiday in Europe, or write your novel, or fix up an old house you've inherited, whatever. Those three months make up about 25% of your annual hours, so we'd reduce your annual pay to $75,000 -- but we'd continue to pay you year-round, *even during your three months of leave*.

**Compressed Workweek**: work extra hours without taking overtime, then convert those extra hours into time off. A common formulation is to work an extra 50 minutes a day for two weeks, but take the second Friday off with pay, effectively turning every other weekend into a long weekend. (50 minutes * 9 workdays = 450 minutes = 7.5 hours = 1 full day of work.)

**Flex Time**: your manager expects you to work 37.5 hours a week, to be available for meetings Monday to Friday between 10 AM and 3 PM, to attend occasional meetings outside of that window, and to get your work done. Beyond that, your time is yours:

451,dxkrjih,8d6hvr,t5_3f8vd,8,AmhranDeas,,False,t1_dxkrjih,"So, a few things that leap out at me:

* Not completing mandatory training - most of the time, that's a couple of hours or so doing an online course. If you had time to send emails out to other managers looking for a job, surely you had time to do the mandatory training.  Not doing this would make me think you're not taking the job seriously, and it would make me question what else isn't getting done while you do personal things on the government's time.

* Unauthorized days off - this is different from the flexible work arrangement you describe above. Did you take days off that you only asked for after the fact? Or worse, did you call in sick, but then go out in public and do something where someone might have seen you (like, for example, shopping, or going to a restaurant or a bar)? If something like this happened, that's a big, big problem. Not just because you took the unauthorized day off (which means the supervisor can't trust you to respect the rules), but because now your supervisor can't trust that you're telling the truth.

* Unsolicited supervisor and director references - Do you have proof of that your management reached out on their own to speak to managers considering hiring you? It's more likely that a manager to whom you made overtures reached out to your current boss to find out about you. This happens all the time, and is perfectly normal. And they have the right to give whatever reference they see fit.  But if they gave you as bad a reference as you say, then you pissed off two levels of management above you enough to warn others away from hiring you. *You need to step back and ask yourself what you did that made them warn others about you*.

* You say you had a flexible work arrangement with your supervisor, but how did this work in practice? Did you email the night before and say ""hey, could I switch this day for that day? Please let me know"" and then abide by the supervisor's decision if they said ""no, I need you to come in""? Or was it more like ""hey, I'll be in on this day instead of that day"", regardless  of what your supervisor wanted? Switching days like that is *always* at the supervisor's discretion, and they are dealing with a file they need your help on, you should be going in.

All of the above adds up to a massive headache on the part of the supervisor. It isn't about the nuts and bolts of how you handled some specific project or document, this is about the soft skills that are crucial to the working world. Your supervisor was trying to do you a solid by being flexible with work arrangements, which tells me they were trying to make you feel welcome and engaged in the workplace. They could just have easily been a hard-ass and insisted on a specific schedule, and tapped their watch at you if you were late by five minutes. 

By all means, have that sit-down with your supervisor, but honestly, speaking as a supervisor myself, your post is full of red flags.

But there *is* hope. You're young, just barely starting out. Be humble, learn from this. Learn what behaviours are expected in the workplace, and do those to the best of your ability. Next job you get, figure out who the golden boy or golden girl is (the one management thinks walks on water) and behave the way they do, and work the way they work.

497,dxjvyo1,8d245l,t5_3f8vd,11,robotneedsbeer,,False,t1_dxjvyo1,"From most pressing to least, here's my top four. I could do a lot more, but these are the issues that have been the most serious in the last four or five processes we've done. We've done full public with pool, govt only, branch, only. We've used student bridges (a lot, this is by far and away the absolute best way to hire entry-level staff, imo) and most recently a couple of non-advertised appointments (not super comfortable with those as a long-term solution for anything, but sometimes they're needed as a band-aid).

1. A consistent HR ""client manager"". One of the worst problems we've had is advisor churn. This was the leading cause for delay in my last competitive process. Every time a new HR advisor came on stream, we experienced a two-to-three week delay. We had, no word of a lie, more than ten advisors on the file. It took 18 months to complete, from PAR to hire. This created mass confusion among applicants (they didn't know who to contact) and even, we believe lead to some candidate being unable to communicate with us for significant lengths of time (up to a month in one case). This was a cause of significant distress for both candidates and managers.

2. Turn-around-times that have meaning with HR. Even with changing advisors, things like PAR processing, classification (especially using generics), and processing paperwork (e.g. preparing the LoO for signature) should have deterministic timelines that are respected within the HR structure. Preferably, no step should take more than two weeks (from client, back to client). Again, great uncertainty when a manager has to respond back to a client: ""That's with HR, we can't tell you when it might be done"". We waited 4 months for a LoO (to be prepared for signature) on a recent hire. All the candidates were getting very agitated by the end of month 1. You can imagine how people felt with by month 4. Uncertainty in time lines is a huge part of the problem.

3. Meaningful support for managers preparing materials. Managers frequently have to write these from scratch. I'm convinced that this is a major issue with squirrelly and awkward SOMC and the interview and exam question that get written as a result. Managers don't have experience or training with many tools like behavioural interviews. So why are managers the ones who have to write and administer these materials? Why doesn't HR have a) previous SOMCs, exams and interview texts on file as models for managers to work with? b) common formats for things that shouldn't need to be re-written like reference checks and scoring rubrics? Generic job descriptions have been a great help, and have significantly improved classification ""hell"". We need more of that template approach at every step of the process. Candidates benefit from having an even and fair approach to evaluation materials, rather than ones entirely idiosyncratic for each competition.

4. This is the one that you probably won't be able to do: eliminate the idea that a criterion can only be evaluated at one step, then must be ignored at subsequent steps. Why can't interviewers ask about education and experience? Why can't there be a personal suitability question on both the written exam and at the oral stage? Candidates respond differently with different communication strategies. I've always felt it unfair to candidates that, for example, we only evaluate experience by CV, for example. It feels very counter-intuitive, and so confusing, to candidates too. I understand the logic at play here, but I disagree with the ""hurdle"" model it forces candidates and managers to navigate. I think it dehumanizes the process and significantly contributes to the feeling that government evaluations are overly structured and not responsive to manager or candidate needs.

This is a topic I've thought a lot about, as I've had to do a lot of hiring in a lot of different ways in the past 5-6 years. It's a place the service needs some drastic improvement. The NDonS is a welcome initiative, but it's hardly the entire solution, the structural and cultural change we need to fix the current crisis within HR.",True,,1524054650.0,1524025850.0,,t3_8d245l,t3_8d245l,11,0,0

In all seriousness though, and I may catch some down votes for this, but there needs to be a better system to centralize hiring functions (PSC?). The GoC also needs to shift its mindset from *the employee belongs to Unit X, in Department Y*, to *the employee belongs to, and is free to move around the GoC.* Think global, act local.

- Each department maintains a core group of strategic HR advisors/Business Partners, and of course compensation advisors, because...Phoenix.
- Centralized body maintains a repository of up-to-date assessments and recent resumes of all GoC employees, consultants, students, etc.
- Centralized body assesses interested parties for writing, analytical, numeric, etc. skills. The basics. Results are good for 3-5 years? (Think DRAP..PIMS..Priority System for all interested GoC employees - which hopefully is working a lot better now)
- Departmental managers access the repository and conduct short and sweet interviews to hire, deploy, etc. The main evaluations have already been conducted by the centralized body. Now you're just picking the best fit.

I'm sure this system has already been attempted in some form or another, so I don't think Í'm offering any groundbreaking ideas. However, it may actually work now, because individuals and departments are starting (emphasis on starting) to realize the importance and benefits of hiring good, qualified candidates. We also have the technology to facilitate mass evaluations. You click on a test, computer evaluates, your score is saved to your profile. Done!

Are you a term employee or indeterminate? If youre a term, whats the length of the term?

If youre hired as a term employee for *less* than 6 months (January to July, for example), then you arent eligible for benefits until youve been working for six months or until your employment is extended beyond six months total duration. If youre hired as a term *over* 6 months or indeterminate, youre eligible for health benefits as soon as you are hired.

The benefit plans wont show up in your collective agreement. The health and dental plans are negotiated by the National Joint Council and are the same for all employees regardless of which union youre part of or which collective agreement you fall under. Youll find information on the health and dental plans (and the disability insurance plan) on the NJC website: https://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca

For the health care plan, you should only need to be contributing to the plan if you selected level II or III coverage - at level I (the default) the employee contribution is zero (see schedule V of the PSHCP Directive). The only difference between the different coverage levels is the amount that the plan will pay for room and board charges for a stay in a hospital - if you request a private room, for example. At level I its capped at $60/day, at level II its capped at $140/day, and at level III its capped at $220 a day.  Personally, Ive never seen any reason to choose anything other than level I coverage but its up to each person to decide. 

If you have a certificate number assigned to you, then your coverage under the plan is active. You should be able to register on the Sun Life website for the positive enrolment. 

The health plan is administered by Sun Life, and the dental plan is administered by Great West Life. They are two separate plans, with separate certificate/plan numbers. The dental plan has a three-month waiting period.

As a casual end-user in programs work, it's not the best and it's not the worst. It's still not capable of providing the level of detail I need, even at the divisional level, let alone at the unit section or project levels. It's not timely; it can be a month or more behind where we actually are. It does not offer enough flexibility as a forecasting tool. Money has to be committed or not. There seems to be no way to do soft forecasting. There are business process issues in there too, but many issues are structural within the function of SAP.

The interfaces and reporting deserve special mention. It's very 1990s database. Its user interface is astonishing to kids raised with Apple or modern web apps. This is one area where there would seem to be a lot of easy wins which have all been missed.

In short, we wrestle with it, as we wrestled with its predecessors. It does about 2/3rds of what it should do. It's manageable, but since coming in a few years ago, hasn't overall, improved efficiency. We still need to keep  our own ""black books"" to properly manage our finances.

We commonly use another piece software for generating, managing and tracking regulatory and legal datasets. Complexity is similar. SAP often comes out poorly in comparison in both workflow and capability. The interface isn't even comparable in terms of usability (and this has deep effects on workflow). Reporting is extremely primitive in comparison.

2. Poorly-documented and incomprehensible to the vast majority of end-users. End-users are generally only trained in the actual usage of those few transactions deemed necessary to them, and it's taught in the same manner that you might be taught to assemble an Ikea table: put Value A into Slot 4. Put Value B into Slot 3. Execute. Many end-users have no clue how to operate the system without a binder of printouts guiding them through every single step, and those same end-users get into an uproar any time anything changes.
3. Connected to other systems with bubble gum and duct tape. The seams between SAP and parallel systems (like acquisition cards, travel approvals, cartography, inventory control, etc.) are highly visible and frequently break down.
4. Completely disjointed from department to department. Being trained as an SAP end-user at one department does not equip you to use the tool at another, not even to perform the exact same functions using the exact same transactions. (This is largely the result of the thousands and thousands of workarounds to which I alluded earlier.)
5. Failing, in many cases, to make government paperless. At a previous department of mine, switching onto SAP easily tripled the amount of paper over what we got out of the departmental legacy system.
6. A process by which the actual business needs of the organisation are snatched away from the operations people who actually implement these processes, and instead handed over to a group of consultants who tend to redesign the function to suit SAP. (At the rollout to which I alluded to earlier, the on-site subject-matter experts were continually stonewalled by the visiting consultants: SAP can't do that, the new process doesn't allow that, we'll need to take that up with Public Works and see whether it's in-scope, SAP can't do that, we have a new process for that and it involves 12 steps instead of 2, SAP can't do that... and these questions were about basic functions which were built into legacy systems and were pretty fundamental to on-the-ground operations in this instance.)

My take-away is that they don't actually *want* SAP power users except at the very highest levels. The means by which they train and equip end-users to work with SAP suggests that they want us to know as little as necessary and to think only in terms of the functions we're taught by rote, rather than having us gain broader knowledge and begin to consider how we might do things better or more efficiently -- and while you're at it, internalize this ever-changing list of counterintuitive workarounds, or else the whole system breaks down.

DEVELOPMENT IN THE PHENIX CLASS ACTIONS


The Quebec Superior court allows the classe action against the Canadian Government regarding the moral damages in the Phoenix pay system matter.


Class Action Authorized


On April 3rd, 2018, the Superior Court authorized our class action on behalf of employees and ex-employees of the Government of Canada. The Action claims damages related to the Phoenix Pay System. 

 
Who is included in the class? 


The Class covers all of Canada. 
 

The status of included members was limited by the Court. Employees who have a right to file a grievance under section 208 of the Federal Public Sector Labor Relations Act were excluded from the Class. This affects both unionized and non-unionized employees. 
 

The resulting Class is composed of all employees and ex-employees who cannot file a grievance, among which Students, Occasional employees and Retirees. 
 

Our team is concerned about the excluded members access to justice, especially for non-unionized employees such as managers. Without access to a form of collective representation or to independent arbitration of their claims, these persons will form a sizeable but largely silent subgroup. We are currently reviewing the possibility of filing an appeal on this issue. 
 

In any case, it is imperative for employees and ex-employees to file a grievance without delay, or to try to do so. If your grievance is refused by your union or the Government, ask for a proof of refusal and provide it to us.
 

Actions to take


Members included in the Class definition do not have any action to take. They will automatically form part of the Class. Over the following weeks, notices will be approved by the Court and published.

I know of colleagues who have over 6 months worth of sick days banked because they didn't ""abuse"" of it.

On the other end, holidays, those have to be used. You can only bank up to 2.5 your alotted holiday hours per year, otherwise they are cashed out (well, once Phoenix is fixed). So financially, if I have the choice of being paid out my holidays (at a higher tax rate) or taking them and not upping my yearly salary.. I'll take the time off.

I have seen some people have to take leave without pay due to emergencies happening and them not having enough leave banked. 

Although I am also cognizant that for people who have children, especially small ones, more illness is a reality. Small kids are very good disease vectors, so there will be more time off. Same with older people who are more prone to have chronic health conditions that require more time off. 

With that said, back when the government was freaking out over the number of sick days, it occurred to me that if there was an option to cash out your sick leave when you retire, even at a great discount (say 25% of its value), it may actually be enough to reduce the number of sick days taken when someone is not actually sick.

Sick leave is different, though. It's a form of insurance to protect your income if you're sick and unable to work. If you use it all up, then you've ""cashed in"" the insurance policy and no longer have any insurance - that's the incentive to not use it unnecessarily.

A few years back I talked with one of our compensation advisors about this (you know, when we had people doing compensation in departments). She told me of many conversations she'd had with employees who called her asking for information about ""short-term disability"". She'd be the one to have to break the news to them that there was no such plan, and that if they had used up all their paid sick leave their only option was to take sick leave *without pay* and that they wouldn't be eligible for long-term disability until 13 weeks after being off work.",True,,1523652315.0,1523623515.0,,t3_8bwoul,t3_8bwoul,6,0,0

The anxiety you feel at taking more than a week off at a time - which is a totally normal and reasonable thing to do! - is something that you should probably work on yourself. I am not saying this in a snide or mean way. I have an anxiety disorder that I see a therapist for.

Bereavement leave can be taken following the death of an immediate family member (as defined in your collective agreement.)

For example, for the CS group: 

17.02 Bereavement leave with pay

For the purpose of this clause, immediate family is defined as father, mother, (or alternatively stepfather, stepmother or foster parent) brother, sister, step-brother, step-sister, spouse (including common-law partner residing with the employee), child (including child of common-law partner) stepchild, foster child or ward of the employee, grandparent, grandchild, father-in-law, mother- in-law, and relative permanently residing in the employees household or with whom the employee permanently resides.

a. When a member of the employees immediate family dies, an employee shall be entitled to a single bereavement period of seven (7) consecutive calendar days. Such bereavement period, as determined by the employee, must include the day of the memorial commemorating the deceased or must be taken within two (2) days following the death. During such period the employee shall be paid for those days which are not regularly scheduled days of rest for the employee. In addition, the employee may be granted up to three (3) days leave with pay for the purpose of travel related to the death.

b. An employee is entitled to up to one (1) days bereavement leave with pay for the purpose related to the death of his son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law and grandparent of spouse.

c. It is recognized by the parties that the circumstances that call for leave in respect of bereavement are based on individual circumstances. On request, the deputy head of a department may, after considering the particular circumstances involved, grant leave with pay for a period greater and/or in a manner different than that provided for in clauses 17.02(a) and (b).

d. If, during a period of sick leave, vacation leave or compensatory leave, an employee is bereaved in circumstances under which he or she would have been eligible for bereavement leave with pay under paragraphs 17.02(a) or (b), the employee shall be granted bereavement leave with pay and his or her paid leave credits shall be restored to the extent of any concurrent bereavement leave with pay granted.

Done perfunctorily, without a lot of effort, they're meaningless. There are definitely managers who grade inflate too, though we've had word that grading will be scrutinized in my department this year (no giving your entire team S+ or S-, for example).

If done right, I do think it's a good value to manager and employee, as valuable as report cards can be to students.

Both can get a sense of what expectations are and how the manager feels they need to be met. This is critical to turning job descriptions into employee activities. The PMP is where the rubber hits the roads, so to speak, and where that gets documented.

I like to use it as an opportunity as well to get each of my reports to summarize their half/year. As part of our discussion, we frequently add to that as well---two people remember better than just one. That's valuable too, I think, and important to quantify the grading. Did they get more done than anticipated or more than their description would require? That evidence of an S+. Were they late or did they miss a few things? Maybe that's an S-. In any case, this provides part of the ranking.

The part I do before our review is the less tangibles (but still in their critera). Typically these are communication, teamwork and (particular to our work) quality management and health and safety. Again I document, and explain/discuss my thoughts during the review, again so that this can be included in the ranking.

Then, based on that evidence/documentation, we discuss the ranking I've assigned and why.

Finally, I discuss with the employee how they might improve their ranking for the next 6-month cycle. This will be very concrete: you need to do x, y, z. For over-performers, these are ""stretch goals"", for under-performers, this might even include a formal performance improvement plan with deadlines and milestones. This portion of the discussion also includes the employees thoughts too, where they want their job to go, what ambitions they might have in terms of advancement, mostly so that I can make sure they get training they might need, or put it on the wishlist of possibles if resources allow. I certainly don't force them to tell me what their plans are, but do let them know that I want to help if I can, and a number of taken me up on that for training or for new work opportunities.

For example, there was a robust discussion about how IT and technical projects are managed, assigned and rolled up -- but that's not just about IT projects, is it? To get to the root of that, we need to talk about management of this type throughout the entire public service, and that thread goes *deep*:

Consider that, outside of the security and intelligence departments and agencies, it seems like people are much likelier to get into the executive grades starting from EC than they are from any other occupational group. (Indeed, several departments have explicit pathways and programs to this effect.) This results in a managerial class which tends to come from the NCR-focused policy side, and it's not at all uncommon to find committees of Directors General or ADMs who have spent virtually their whole careers in EC -> EX within the NCR.

This has knock-on effects when it comes to thinking about how targets are set, how projects are managed, how problems are viewed and prioritized, and which constituencies within the public service get heard -- problems which aren't helped by the decision to treat functions like IT as services delivered by vendors instead of embedded functions which are intrinsic to the business. If, throughout your career, you're systematically conditioned to view IT as a utilitarian service provided by another branch or division (instead of as a partner who can help improve your business and make your life easier), then when you yourself make it to a corner office on the 19th floor, how likely are you to give IT a seat at the table when you pursue a project with implications for them? Do you consult with them and consider their perspective from the very beginning, or do you nail down your requirements and expectations with a team of other executives with similar backgrounds, then start requesting quotes, the same as you would with any other extrinsic vendor? (Or, hey, maybe you even decide to farm it out to a consultant: why waste you time on something so far outside your knowledge, understanding and interest?)

But. But! That story's not just about IT.

Finance professionals, especially those who work on the operations end, are *also* hungry for a seat at the table.  So are people who work in staffing. Training and Development specialists are in the same boat, along with virtually *every*body in the regions, among others. These people have been raising concerns and complaints along these lines for decades. If we ""solve"" the IT problem by, like, creating more pathways for IT professionals to become EXes, we've ignored the deeper structural issue.

*Fixing* that structural issue involves rethinking the whole pathway to management, the way working departments interact with ""non-business"" units, the way that ""non-business"" units view themselves, the corporate culture in the public service, the wisdom of saving money by consolidating features and acculturating people to view them as internal vendors, the relationship between headquarters and the regions... and, like, good luck fixing all that.",True,,1522988495.0,1522959695.0,,t3_8a2ssb,t3_8a2ssb,19,0,0

To keep it simple, it's the people, the culture, the lack of systems thinking, and egos that are holding us back. There is certainly no shortage of talent, nor resources to achieve IM/IT modernization initiatives, but we are not assigning the right people to the right jobs, because...seniority gets first pick of files, and... because someone wants to have their name on a high profile project, even though they lack the knowledge and experience required. Also, please stop politicizing all projects. It's not necessary and creates undue fear, pressure and constraints.

Recently, there was an admission that Phoenix was managed as an IT project instead of a transformation / change management project which would have integrated multiple other factors, including resistance to change by end users.

Also, even if we manage to implement a working system, in all fairness, it's not feasible to ask someone who has been pushing paper and using rubber stamps - literally - for 30 years to all of a sudden have to learn six to ten, possibly more, digital applications and keep up with the newer generation(s). This could have, and should have, been taken into consideration, if managed as a transformation project. I would suggest that the same is true for all IT initiatives.

2. stop hiring consultants, they just see blood in the water when government tenders a contract. we have no ability articulate what we really want and no stomach for a fight when we get screwed
3.  overall, we've followed a poisonous development methodology of keeping IT folks separate from business folks, this means neither side understands the other.

1064,dwtg501,89t35g,t5_3f8vd,14,robotneedsbeer,,False,t1_dwtg501,"1. We're considerably behind where we were in 2000 in terms of web access. What used to be live applications aged out in the 2000s and have now simply been replaced by static .csvs and shapefiles in Open Data. It's really pathetic when I look at what my US colleagues are able to accomplish. Even at the state levels where funding levels are much lower than our service.
2. E-mail post-transformation is significantly slower and less reliable than when the servers were located at our headquarters. And yet every time I point this out someone will invariably tell me that I'm wrong about that.
3. Near every terrible Phoenix story (lack of pay for students, people not being paid on leave, etc...) we've experienced in my directorate. The human costs have been high. We're still paying them.
4. The shared drives have actually been improving in the past year, both in speed and reliability. We got an increase in space recently that only took 6 months and less than a dozen followups to process.
5. The choice to to a java application for a cross-platform identity (MyKey) seems to be one of the classic awful IT gong-shows that can only result of too many committees with too little knowledge or concern for how anything works in practice.
6. The disconnect between between IT and the rest of the service is absolutely deadly. this is one barrier I would change if given a magic wand for a day. SSC is perceived almost universally, even our departmental IT, as the enemy to getting the job done; remote, unaccountable, arbitrary and capricious in their decision making (approvals etc..). Neither outcomes or timelines for anything are predictable. The only office worse to deal with in government is the Pay Centre. To be fair, TB is actually responsible for at least some of the problems on the policies side, but as the boots on the ground SSC gets all the blame. 
7. The policy of not allowing embedded CS people is baffling. Why is it so bad that programs could be self-supporting for application development or data warehousing? In cases where that happens informally (where we've managed to pry loose programming capability, usually scientists who are double trained, and ~~data centres~~ ~~servers~~ workstations), systems have continued to be high-functioning, even to be able to offer capabilities to other groups. Where we have to officially access development through ""program groups"" we've almost been universally disappointed with the results. They lack domain knowledge and have little to no ability respond in a flexible or robust manner. Projects usually die, half-completed, of paralysis.

Looks like the decline is tied to sunsetting of extra resources committed to EI processing. Details here: https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/reports/departmental-plan/2018/planned-results.html#h2.3

The FTE reductions are mostly in program 2.1 (Skills and Employment) and the notes say the following:

>Human resources (Full-time equivalents [FTEs])
>2017-2018: 9,120
>2018-2019: 8,434
>2019-2020: 8,291
>The main reason for the reduction in FTEs is the sunsetting of Employment Insurance workload funding. This is temporary funding received by the Department to offset volume increases. The figures cited in this report do not reflect any future decisions that the Government may or may not take to renew funding.

As to exactly *how* those reductions occur, it's hard to tell, but my guess would be ending term employment for any term employees who are ""sunset funded"" under that program. ",True,,1522900112.0,1522871312.0,,t3_89sgd1,t3_89sgd1,3,0,0

For example this government spends billions of dollars and a lot of it is done through transfer payments. If the Conservatives win the next election, they would likely get elected with a deficit reduction platform, and those positions would become at risk. If the billions flowed through new programs with full staff (for infrastructure it means engineers, architects, technicians, procurement, project management, policy experts and analysts, etc.)  then if those programs were eliminated and most likely not replaced, there would be layoffs like we had a few years ago.

People retiring may alleviate this, and another mandate of large deficits if the Liberal Party is re-elected (or if the NDP wins) would likely delay but make it worse 4 years later. 

There are also the questions of economics, with all the trade wars Trump is starting, the NAFTA renegotiation, etc. who knows what the economy will look like in two years? If we are going through a recession a conservative government would have to keep spending money, likely for infrastructures, which may require hiring more people.

So trends are not that easy to see coming. Each occupational group is also different, with task automation we may not need as many CRs and AS-01, there may be a new powerful software that works better than lawyers, passport employees at the counter may be replaced with self-service screens like at McDonald's...

I created a short procedure for new employees about the process I had to go through. I'll just mention that there are health benefits and dental benefits. You become eligible to apply for health benefits on the day you became and indeterminate employee. You become eligible for dental 3 months after the day you became indeterminate, and you are automatically enrolled. (It may take more than 3 months for dental as the pay centre is having issues with automatic enrolment for new employees. It's always good to call and check up.) For your public service health care plan(PSHCP), follow the procedure below:

1.	First call the pensions office at 1-800-561-7930 and ask for your pensions number. (You'll need your PRI to confirm identity).

2.	If they tell you that they dont have your pensions number, it may be because they havent updated your file in the system as indeterminate. In that case, youll have to call the pay centre (phoenix) at 1-855-686-4729 and open a ticket to have your employment status updated.

Note: Youll have to wait a week or two until they send the updated information to the pensions office. The pensions office will then generate a pensions number for you.

3.	After you obtain your pensions number by calling the pensions office again, complete these two forms: 

http://www.pshcp.ca/media/1688/emp-applic-adhes-006491.pdf

http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/remuneration-compensation/services-paye-pay-services/form/documents/446-5-v5-eng.pdf

Note: Leave section 4 of the 446-5 document blank as you dont need a manager to apply on your behalf for a health application.

4.	Email both of them to centredepaye.paycentre@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca and CC your manager. You will receive a confirmation email that they've received your application.

Once theyve processed your request, you will receive a letter in the mail with your certificate number (this will be a unique number just for you) and you contract number (055555).

5.	Use your certificate and contract number to complete positive enrolment from the Sun Life website. 

After completing positive enrolment, youll receive a confirmation letter by mail and finally (possibly a few weeks later), obtain your PSHCP benefit card.

It's definitely worse for Quebec people coming into Ontario, IMO, and even at 630 it's noticeable (but definitely less so than at 8am or later). That being said, it kind of depends on WHERE in hull you live. If you are close to the bridge, even with traffic you are looking at a rapid commute. If you are ""deep"" in Hull, then it might become more of an issue. If you aren't overly attached to your car, I'd say you can avoid the headache of traffic by just walking, if you live close enough. It is actually pretty nice because you walk past the Chaudière falls. In warmer weather you can bike, and it's pretty hilly so it's a nice little workout!

Three bases to work from:

1. Even if your experience isn't *great*, being able to say something like ""I worked for four months doing work equivalent to an EC-01"" can make a hiring manager's job much easier. Play this angle up.
2. You're in a strong position to seek agency or casual employment. These are far from ideal (no job security, limited prospects, no training or development, etc.), but they let you keep a foot in the door, get you out of your current boss' hands, and anyone with government experience (even FSWEP or trivial clerical experience) is at an advantage in seeking it.
3. If you can find a manager who wants to hire you, you can be bridged in. (Bridging is an option exclusively open to former co-op and FSWEP students by which a manager can basically point at you and say ""you're hired"", without applying for anything or going through a process or any of that other rigmarole. There's no expiry date, either: if it takes you two years to meet this manager, that's fine, you'd still be eligible for bridging.)

The common route for this is to deploy out or (in your case) find a new FSWEP position in a different group or another department.

- If possible, get in touch with your previous managers, thank them for the opportunity, and see if they are willing to write you a letter of reference. Use them as a reference in the future, especially if they have managed you longer than the current one.

Mainly because they are not reliable long term. Most will move up, take an assignment, or return to school full-time. It's unfortunate for those starting out. My advice would be to show initiative, be proactive, and bring forward solutions (rather than just contacting your manager with problems). Basically show you have worth and potential. Don't play on your smartphone at your desk, or browse the internet all day. It sounds silly, but starting out you need to indulge in a lot of 'make work' projects to demonstrate your trying to make a difference. Network with coworkers professionally, not socially. Your manager basically isn't looking out for your best interest, they want to keep you in the same position. However, your coworkers may take notice of your efforts and recommend you to other managers or to apply on various positions. It's easy to be jaded by the beurocracy, but just keep working hard and pump out exceptional products and deliverables. Look at the requirements for the position you really want and try and work towards gaining experience to meet those qualifications. Basically, perform at a level higher than what you were hired to do, and it will be easier to land where you want to go. Remember you are still starting out, so stay humble. I've seen a few younger workers do the bare minimum, act like they know everything and then bitch that they're not getting anywhere. 


Also, you don't need to use your direct manager as a reference. In some cases that can backfire on career advancement.

As to the logistics, there is no such thing as an indeterminate box. There are just boxes, and they might be filled with a term employee or with an indeterminate employee. So a rollover is just an indeterminate appointment to the same position that youre already occupying as a term. 

The paperwork for a roll-over is minimal - just confirmation that the employee has worked for the department for the required time (three years) without a break in service longer than 60 consecutive calendar days, confirmation that the person still meets the security/language requirements of the position, and a formal offer letter.

This may not seem relevant to a question like this, but you have to get the context. Something like 15% of public servants in Ottawa are formally acting in another job, and many more are doing so informally. The public service is full of people doing work which, 30 years ago, would have been assigned to 2-3 people, and a great many specialists find themselves bogged down in clerical and administrative work which often represents a poor use of their time. (Textbook example: instead of hiring a clerk to support a team of 12 social workers, we make them do their own clerical work: their own filing, their own travel planning, their own financial forecasting and reconciliation, their own paperwork, etc. This shows up as a cost savings in Ottawa [we eliminated a clerical job!], but it also means that we're paying people $40/hour to file pieces of paper [instead of paying that clerk $16/hour], and it means that each of them has fewer hours a week to devote to the actual meat of their work.)

And this type of documentation and disciplining is time-intensive, emotionally draining and often disproportionate to the difficulty caused by someone's incompetence.

Like, let's say you manage a team of 3 people. One of those people only does half as much work as the other two. Those other two are going to feel the increase in workload, be hyperaware of this person's incompetence, and it's going to manifest in poor outputs. Management needs to take action.

What if you manage a team of 20, with one incompetent person? Most of your people wouldn't notice an increase in workload. It's unlikely this will manifest as a measurable decrease in the quality of outputs. They might be aware of the incompetence in their midst, and this might have impacts upon morale, but they wouldn't be as stark as the team of 3 I just discussed.

In the latter environment, is the need to discipline this person ever going to be the most important thing a manger could be doing with their day? Because their day's already full *without* this additional work and worry: they're already pulling 10-hour days just to keep on top of their ordinary workload. And if the situation's basically functional (it sucks to have an incompetent person along for the ride, but things are chugging along), do you really want to dedicate time and effort to this?

This does create a tolerance for incompetence, and it's bad. It makes us look bad. It encourages under-performance in others. (Well, if Janet's going to leave half an hour early every single day, why am I still sitting here?) It degrades our performance as a whole. But, again, management is already by and large working themselves silly just to keep the lights on, and doesn't really have an incentive to move a task like this to the top of their pile.

Secondarily, this culture of understaffing has two impacts upon HR:

1. HR is usually one of the most skeletal teams at a department, and they tend to be so understaffed and bogged down that it routinely takes more than a year to fill even an entry-level vacancy. If you fire someone, it might be 18 months before you get a replacement for them -- and that's 18 months of active follow-up, maybe churning through 4-5 different HR contacts, of reviewing dozens of applicant files, of designing exams... it's not 18 months of idle waiting, it's yet more work on your part.
2. Some departments are *extremely* aggressive about shutting down vacant positions. This, combined with the prior point, means that vacating a box may mean it disappears altogether: ""Well, this position has been vacant for a year, and you're doing just fine, so obviously you don't really need it. We're closing the position.""

Both of these things can spook managers out of taking action, even when they feel it's justified and necessary, because they'd rather have an incompetent warm body in the position than lose the position altogether, or have to go a year or longer waiting for it to be filled.

In other words, counterintuitive as it sounds, I think one of the best fixes for public-sector incompetence is to staff the public sector appropriately: give managers the administrative and clerical support they need in order to free themselves up for higher-order tasks; ensure that managers can find time in their schedules for Good Ideas which aren't necessarily immediate priorities (including this type of staff discipline); and ensure that managers aren't pressured to keep people around just because they're worried about losing the box or being shortstaffed for ages and ages and ages while it gets filled.",True,,1521966489.0,1521937689.0,,t3_86voih,t3_86voih,52,0,0

- They know their collective agreements inside and out (better than the policies, rules and regulations required to do their jobs)
- They know how the system works - i.e. no one is going to do anything.

**Many Different Reasons for Why No One Takes Action:** 

- They have seen how difficult the process is, which usually ends up going nowhere,
- Are unwilling to rock the boat after years of trying to get the coveted management position - which as it turns out isn't as exciting as they thought it would be,
- Aren't able to justify why they provided no training, failed to document issues etc.,
- Are tired, getting older, have a mortgage, wife and kids, and just want to ride out the rest of their time in peace so they can retire and finally start living,
- Are weak and just want to keep the masses happy and have everyone adore them,
- Are insecure and like to surround themselves with people who are weaker and more incompetent.
- The same union that represents middle managers, also represents the employee.
- Aren't comfortable with having difficult conversations and don't really know where to turn for appropriate advice.

I worked for <department A> on and off from 2007 to early 2016. Probably did around 6-7 casuals and one 2 years with an agency. During those years, I did another 2 contracts with <department B> in 2009 and 2015.


<Department A> opened had a poster for indeterminate somewhere around November 2012. I applied. Feb 2013 I finished the last college class I needed. Fast forward somewhere in late 2014. They're now interviewing people for the very job I'm doing. I get ~first place on the list~ apparently. Early 2015, I get told that since I didn't have my last class done (hence my college degree) back when the pool start, I won't be considered. I was shattered.


Learned later that the poster actually said degree **or** 2 years. Sigh... I got fucked.


Fast forward some more time, Sept 2015. <Department B> calls me. They need me to replace their tech for 3 months (surgery). I busted by ass for 3 months. Somewhere in December, Team Lead tells me his manager will have a poster shortly, to apply and he'd put in a good word. Which he did. Did the interview, etc. Landed a 2 years term. (They actually had to move a job position from Ottawa to my region). Started on Halloween 2016. I busted my ass for a whole year and they made me indeterminate. I was in shock. I kept on pushing and I'm now CS02.


I guess this doesn't really explain how hard it is to get an indeterminate CS01, but I just want you to know that, it's a bit of a case-by-case, some departments (In my case Department A) are filled up with ~~lazy-boomers-close-to-retirement~~ management that just wants to do as little as possible until then.

It's okay to realize that you are stupid and will make dumb mistakes. The first thing I tell people who work for me is: if I'm being stupid or a dumbass, tell me. Nobody has but will come in my office when they think a bad decision is being made (even if I'm the one making the dumb decision) and often time they're right. 

I've had my share of being right pissed at the higher ups and having to deal with decisions that were dumb and it is frustrating to pass those down the chain of command, but it is NEVER okay to lose your shit.

**A Few Home Truths:**
The reason there are so few millenials is because by the time they make it through the lengthy hiring process, they are:

- Already in their 30s.
- Disillusioned that the job wasn't as advertised.
- Surprised at the number of jaded workers who literally have a pension countdown clock on their desk (will that be me some day?)
- Still unaware of the benefits of a stable job and raising a family in a city like Ottawa. This only comes into focus after they've lived a little, bought the T-shirt, and are well into their 30s. 

In my humble opinion, there is too much focus on recruiting *millenials*, when the focus should be on recruiting *specific skill sets* which will propel GoC into the 21st century; it's much more inclusive and far more effective in the long run [*If you build it, they will come*] Having said that, generally speaking and by default, it's mostly millenials who will possess the KSA's relating to emerging technologies.

Apart from the optics and the calcification, you also need to consider that -- absurd at this sounds -- the rate of advancement from the junior grades (in AS/CR-land in particular) seems to greatly outpace the rate of replenishment of those grades, at least at the departmental headquarters I inhabit. Even Directors General can't hang onto their AS-01 and 02s, because they get poached or moved up the org chart as quickly as boxes come available. I know one person in particular who was hired as an indeterminate CR-04 in July, was acting in an AS-02 by November, got appointed to an indeterminate AS-01 in April, and then an indeterminate AS-03 by August, all without competitions: if that trajectory is possible (for someone who's, like, *good* at their job, yet not someone I'd consider a high-flyer), how are you supposed to keep a good CR-04 down on the farm?

1685,dvshtmf,84u5kj,t5_3f8vd,5,Majromax,,False,t1_dvshtmf,"To elaborate on /u/yesmaybepossibly's comment, the difference is indeed that Québec considers employer-paid health benefits to be part of taxable income, whereas CRA does not.

You should be able to verify this for yourself.  Box A of your RL-1 should equal the sum of box 14 of your T4 (federally-defined employment income) and Box J of your RL-1 (employer-paid premiums to a private health insurance plan).

That Box J amount is in turn calculated based on the employer-share of PSHCP and PSDCP contributions.  For the PSHCP, you can see the [employer rate](https://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/d9/v9/s87/en#s87-tc-tm_4) from the Health Care Plan Directive; the taxable benefit is the amount listed there times 1.09 to account for a Québec sales tax on insurance premiums.

For the PSDCP, there are yearly [information notices](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/information-notice/quebec-taxable-benefits-2017-2018-rates.html) published defining the effective employer rates.  

If you're interested in calculating the QIT withholding per-paycheque using Revenu Québec's formulas, then you will need to include these employer-paid amounts alongside your salary for determining taxable income (for QIT and QPP, but not QPIP).

The Box J amount should also be approximately equal to the sum of the year-total PSHCP and PSDCP ""Employer Paid Benefits"" amounts, from the last pay-stub of the year.

Note that when you go to file your taxes, the Box J amount is considered an eligible medical expense for the respective Québec tax credit.  Between the employer-paid premiums and any medical expenses not fully covered by insurance (such as the 20% not covered for many treatments/drugs), it's comparatively easy to exceed the 3%-income threshold for claiming the tax credit.",True,,1521229699.0,1521200899.0,,t3_84u5kj,t3_84u5kj,5,0,0

The amount was not large by any means (less than $200). I followed up with the department claim officer once in a while, but it's really a waiting game. The department claim officer is just a point of contact designated by TBS. For example, the claim officer in my agency is the Financial Controls Director, but I mostly exchanged emails with a few of her employees.

The claim was analysed by her team, it seems like they work with templates issued by TBS. They calculated exactly how much money I was owed (I was missing a few hundred dollars per pay check) by using my Phoenix paystubs and my letter of offer, they looked at my credit statement to see how much interest I'm paying on my line of credit and allowed a reimbursement for the precise amount I was owed. For example, I was underpaid by about $1,100 per pay check. So if I had a $2,000 debt on my line of credit, they calculated how much interest I paid on the first $1,100 and approved this amount. Then they request permission from TBS to issue a reimbursement.

My claim was partially approved. I find it incredibly funny that a CPA and a few of her account payable assistants had to sift through my pay stubs, my credit line statements and calculate the exact amount. Complete waste of their time.

At the end of the day, I didnt accept the reimbursement. The reimbursement is processed as a *claim against the Crown*, similar to if a public servant damages a car while going to a meeting or if you break something in your hotel room while on travel duty. The government will settle with the claimants, as directed by the *Directive on Payments*. The last step before issuing a payment is to obtain a release from the claimant, which states that the government accept no responsibility, liability or cause on the parts covered by the claim and bars the claimant from pursuing any legal actions, grievances, court orders or anything related to the portion settled by the reimbursement. I refused to sign this release and it was been sitting on their desks for the last few months.

I recommend having a solid rationale and writing a good claim statement. You have to be thorough and explain everything, as you would in a grievance. You also have to provide statements or proof to support your claim. I dont know what youll need to support your case, but its more than just a written statement. The claim officer can probably answer your questions. If you dont receive a reply in a reasonable timeline, dont hesitate to contact their bosses.

They have an independent review board for their own promotion system somewhat unique in the service. Roughly comparable to a university faculty member; requires not just a Ph.D., but also a further academic pedigree, including postdoc research experience. The prototypical subject matter expert (SME) job. Senior RES-5 scientists are expected to be global leaders in their field. SE RES classes cannot be management.

**SE REM** - The ""Research Manager"" who is supposed to manage SE RES positions. Generally requires a post graduate degree in science. EX-1 and EX-2 equivalents.

**PC** - ""Physical scientists"" - A general catchall for physical, geological, environmental science and science related activity. Some are lab jobs, many are not. A broad category that can range from pure research, to field inspections to regulation-driven routine lab work, to a desk job dealing with science policy, and even some inter-governmental and international work. Often SMEs/departmental spokespeople at senior ranks. Uniquely, unlike the other SPI classes, the top end are director-level equivalents. They require a BSc, but many have post graduate degrees.

**BI** - ""Biological Scientists"", similar to the PC class, but dealing with biology, life and heath sciences. Again, a broad class, including bench scientists, scientific regulators, science policy workers and even foreign service delegates. Again, often SMEs at the senior ranks. They require a BSc, but many have post graduate degrees.

**CH** - ""Chemistry"", the bench chemist, usually in a routine, regulatory service role (e.g. measuring air pollution, but not doing direct research), though certainly not exclusively. Large overlaps with the PC class. They require a BSc, but many have post graduate degrees.

**AG** - ""Agriculture Scientists"", very similar to the BI class, specific for agricultural/farm research and policy. Almost all in Agriculture and CFIA. They require a BSc, but many have post graduate degrees.

**FO** - ""Forestry"", very similar to the BI class, again very specific to a few departments like NRCan. They require a BSc, but many have post graduate degrees.

**MT** - ""Meterologists"", A narrow class particular mostly to ECCC, and then only to a single branch, the Meteorological Service of Canada. BSc. minimum, and often highly trained in IT as well. They do the weather and associated tasks like climate change modelling.

**EG** - ""Engineering and Scientific Support"" The laboratory technician role. These people often do labwork, supervised by one of the more senior science roles, SE-RES, CH, BI, AG, MT, FO, or PC. Some EG roles are science-related, but desk jobs, things like waste management and quality control. Higher levels may be supervisory, but the top end is below executive levels. Education is typically a college certificate, though university degrees are common too.

Note that due to the large overlap and slightly incompatible pay and ex-equivalency scales between the various Applied Science and Patent Examination - Applied Science classes (PC & CH) and (BI, AG, & FO), there's some pressure from TB to collapse or reduce use of some of the classes.

* The majority of the cases that are heard by the board are dismissed. While every case is decided on its individual facts, there is a high bar required to prove something like abuse of authority. 

* The result of the complaint rarely results in anything that directly benefits the person who made the complaint. That person doesnt typically get the job as a result of their complaint. At most, an appointment could be set aside and the department ordered to run a new staffing process.

On the whole, given the stress and time involved I dont think they are particularly useful.

For me the security clearance was a bit of a hurdle since I lived overseas, but my now manager and director were incredible to respond and follow up with both me and HR/admin. I got reliability clearance first, with the idea that it would be quicker, and was just recently upgraded to secret. The letter of offer comes after the security clearance, and I had to come back to Canada and travel to Ottawa ASAP in order to submit my security clearance forms and for them to take my fingerprints. The reliability clearance took about a month and a half (included in there the waiting time for requesting a police certificate from abroad), then my letter of offer came really soon after the clearance was granted. I submitted the clearance docs Sept 25, got my LOO Nov 2, and my first day at work was Nov 14. 

Answer to 1) have you submitted clearance forms and been fingerprinted? If not maybe starting to prepare for that by requesting police certificates from countries you've resided in for 6 months or longer over the last 10 years would be a good idea, your LOO depends in a big part on how quickly the clearance will go through. If you've applied for other jobs in the government, the police certificates are still a good idea as they'll be needed regardless. 
2) I think they will give you a date, if they don't when they send you the LOO, ask when they would like your reply.

Ideally, one should report cohabitation and legal partnerships to HR if the couple is working in the same unit or division. If separating the two is not feasible, then they should be made aware of the code of conduct and other related policies, especially within the context of personal relationships. One would hope that adults can continue to behave in a professional manner for the duration of a relationship, and also after a break up. If one or both are unable to leave the drama out of the workplace, then action must be taken immediately to avoid poisoning the work environment.

Also, while the conflict of interest is quite obvious when a couple is in a direct reporting relationship with one another, there is another more subtle conflict that *may* occur.

I am currently a 3 within a small organization working in security. There is no shortage of work and always something to do, either policy (awareness, departmental directives etc...) or operational (new tool implementation, investigation, forensics).

So that being said, here is what I have to say on the topic:

Keeping in mind the inception of the CyberCenter which will be located in the east end most likely, but not in the Drake building (lack of room), and also the potential requirements of Enhanced TS Clearance (not the same as standard TS Clearance) - and this is still to be confirmed, there is a lot in limbo about the staffing and the transfer of responsibilities. SSC's CITS team is pretty big, going from AD Management, to Firewall/Perimeter to PKI management. What is known is that the SSC SOC/CCIRC/GC-CIRT will most likely be transferred over to this cybercenter, but not sure about the other roles. There is talks about other responsibilities, but only rumors at this time. 

That being said, when you go to SSC, you will work in one field and one field only, without touching anything else unless you move. IE: If you work in Perimeter, your sole job is managing a firewall, not the LAN/WAN or traffic. You don't do any endpoint investigation, all that goes back to the departmental IT Security team.

As for CRA, knowing they have a pretty big team and responsibility (5 pts to the person who can tell me what is CRA's primary business - it's not what you think), working in Cyber there, you will have a lot more exposure to the different technologies available that they use to maintain and manage their environment. 

But as others have mentioned, but I am not familiar with, is that as an Agency, transferring from that agency to a Core department may be a bit more trouble.

As for CS-04 uni-lingual, these are like the fable unicorn... you hear of them and may be promised one, however, with the push from OL to have senior positions or all bilingual (until the OL is reviewed to better adapt to current language requirements/flexibility) they are rare, and once a grand-fathered position is empty, OL is usually pretty quick to want to change the language requirements.

Hope this helps

All the manager did was give him only a month worth of experience and then justify it by saying the guy had ""experience in so and so"". It was shady but the New Staffing policy allows that.  With non-advertised appointments, a manager could in theory go to some random person on the street and say ""hey,do you have experience in this?"" and if yes BOOM he is hired.  While this might sound positive to some, the policy allows a manager to hire *anybody* so long as there is some sort of justification(which is not hard to do). So that's what I mean, I see the policy as too loose and unregulated and thus easily susceptible to abuse.

The policy has its merits but I think it needs to be reformed with audit measures to protect against abuse and favoritism.

We generally do ask for this when we hire researchers, but not everyone does. We're weird in that respect apparently: we evaluate for research jobs using research criteria, which is total outside of typical HR recommendations.

You might, as a courtesy ask the panel if they want you to do a seminar. They may well say yes, and it would be an excellent chance for you to meet the team and evaluate if you want to be part of it. But a seminar can't be part of the formal evaluation process if they don't ask for it. There's nothing to lose here at all, and this shows willing on your part. Go for it.

A word of warning: this isn't going to be much about research or technical ability, for various stupid internal reasons*. Be prepared for structured behavioural interviewing. Look up the STAR technique for responding to structured interviews. I would recommend you do some practice questions too. Try to keep responses reasonably sort, less than 5 minutes or so. Say what you have to say and stop. That's what they're expecting. Do have questions for them as well about the job and any details they may not have provided info for.

Especially, do ask if this is a research job (a RES class) or if it's a ""program"" job (A BI or some other ""science"" class), if  this isn't identified on the job poster/ad. It should be, but you never know. In both cases, it's worth to ask about what level of research you might be able to expect (80:20 research mix or 50:50 or what). Ask about conference travel as well. Both of those will give you a better sense of what the job is (and whether you want it).

If you have more questions, don't hesitate to ask. I have a lot of experience with this from both sides of the interview table.

*To clarify, they can't directly ask you about education or work experience, or about your scientific skills. They will ask questions to show things like initiative, reliability, teamwork skills, etc...

This would be calculated as a lifetime pension and a bridge benefit. The bridge benefit is only payable until age 65, and then it stops. 

The amount of the bridge benefit is calculated based on a formula that is supposed to roughly equate with what you'd get from CPP at age 65. It isn't exactly the same as the CPP amount, but it should be fairly close.

If the public servant applies for CPP starting at 65, their total income from the PSSA pension and CPP should be the same after 65 as it was from age 60-65, but it's up to the individual to choose when to apply for CPP.

If the person applies for CPP starting at age 60, then from age 60-65 they'd receive the PSSA lifetime pension, the bridge benefit, *and* CPP from ages 60-65. The CPP amount at age 60 would be less than at age 65, though, because it's reduced if you apply early. At age 65 the bridge benefit would end, which would feel a bit like a pay cut. 

Personally, I think there are advantages for public servants to apply for the CPP as early as they can if they retire early. The CPP is reduced if you have zero-earnings years, and there are more of those if you stop working in your 50s.

Good thing is you will still be able to get CPP.  CPP is contribution based, so as log as you paid into it you should be entitled to it.  Think of it as a pot of money that you are entitled to as long as you contribute.

You shouldn't.

Once the PSEE is entirely scored and resolved (meaning that all results are unencumbered and the whole bank is ready to go), managers can start requesting referrals. These normally take three forms:

1. They can search for specific qualifications and credentials.
2. They can search by test scores.
3. They can grab people at random.

In all three cases, managers can also apply geographic filtering (""People whose on-file postal code is within 40 kilometres of Saskatoon, SK""), or search for people willing to work in a given community (""People who indicated they were willing to work in Bathurst, NB"").

If you get pegged by a request, you'll get a notification that you're a candidate for referral: this means you *might* be included in the extract which gets handed to a hiring manager. The manager will not usually consider every candidate in the referral batch: they'll filter it further by picking candidates to consider. (They might receive 40 resumes intending to only make a single hire, and why would they bother interviewing all of you?) Managers are also under no obligation to do anything with a bunch of referrals: they can generate them and decide not to hire, decide to draw on a pool instead, do the whole thing on an anticipatory basis (meaning a job might not even come available), etc. With this in mind, an invitation to be referred is unto itself pretty meaningless.

People with better scores tend to get more referrals, and more interest resulting from those referrals, than people with more mediocre scores. People with specific, easily-searchable and in-demand qualifications (CPA, Engineer, MSW, Computer Science, etc.) tend to get more referrals, and more interest resulting from those referrals, than people with more generic background. People who live near major government centres (especially Ottawa) tend to get more referrals, and more interest resulting from those referrals, than people out in the boonies.

It's actually about public and private spaces and how they have changed as a result of social media and the 24 hour news cycle.

All governments care about message control. Companies do too. There is a legitimate expectation that employees tow the company line when they are on company time.

Scientists have professional opinions and sharing them with each other is part of how they maintain their qualifications and participate in the broader scientific community. 

Before social media and the 24 hour news cycle they could do this without really influencing the media or the public. That's not true anymore.

As far as government scientists are professional scientists they need to be able to share professional opinions within their field of expertise freely, and there is a legitimate public interest in what scientists are saying to each other. As far as they are public employees, they need to respect their employer even when they disagree with them.

The way the US Government has addressed this situation is by allowing scientists to speak within their fields of expertise with a disclaimer that they are not representing the US Government. This would be a reasonable approach for Canada too. 

The media needs to be a bit more responsible about reporting what scientists say though. Scientists are experts in a very narrow field, not in everything, and while they are very important in providing advice to policy makers, they don't always make policy.

In 2011 many (all?) departments put in place a 'freeze' that prevented all automatic rollovers - see [section 7.2 of the TBS Term Employment Policy](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12584). This occurred as part of the ""Deficit Reduction Action Plan"" in the 2011 and 2012 budgets - the general idea was that if departments were anticipating reductions in staffing levels (and therefore layoffs) it made little sense to automatically make temporary staff into permanent staff. 

But that was then, and this is now. Most departments have lifted the freezes, so time worked as a term now counts toward the roll-over after three years. I haven't seen term employees (particularly good ones) given the 'boot' simply because they're about to become indeterminate. In practice a lot of managers don't even understand the roll-over provisions and might not even be aware that an employee is supposed to roll over until *after* they've passed the three-year mark. 

Still, there is huge value to taking an indeterminate position if it's available to you. Indeterminate status is something that is very difficult to be taken away from you, and that stability is valuable. 

That said, if you've been offered a move into the AS stream as a term, that might be more appealing because it'll put you into the AS stream where there tend to be more opportunities, even if it's only a term job. 

A good question to ask the manager is the reason for the position being a term. Is it to back-fill a position because somebody is on leave? Or is it a sunset-funded position?

But. Two things:

1. If you'd have to go out into the regions to do it, especially if you'd be outside of major federal government centres (Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg, Halifax & Vancouver), you're taking a huge risk and may struggle to escape from the job if things go wrong. You may also struggle to find advancement opportunities. In general, I advise that people stay in the major centres unless they either get a golden once-in-a-lifetime opportunity (CR-4 to AS-4? TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT), have an occupational reason to leave (to take over a regional office, to follow a Director who's becoming a DG, because you're an inspector and the regions are where the jobs are in your world, etc.), or have non-career-related needs they hope to meet by doing so.
2. It can be very, very, *very* tough to break out of CR. CRs hit a hard shelf because their work isn't meant to leave any room for discretion: you do the exact task you've been trained to do in the exact manner you've been trained to do it. Conversely, even an AS-1 (and an AS-1 is what you'd likely want coming out of a CR-4) is meant to exercise at least a little discretion: prioritization, escalation, gatekeeping, framing, tasking, etc. This can make it deceptively difficult to acquire the sort of experience which would let you break into AS. This is especially true at entry level: there's no shortage of people who meet the basic merit criteria for a generic AS-1 position, so hiring managers have options and get to be picky. A lot of CRs (a **lot** of CRs) have war stories about this: of losing out on an AS-1 to a student they basically supervised, of working for a department for six years and doing a stellar job and still not getting any upward movement, of the way people just treat CRs in general (in some workplaces, CRs basically get treated as furniture that talks), etc.

In all cases, this isn't a decision we can make for you. Based on what you've presented here, if you're in Ottawa or one of the major centres I listed, I would likely take the CR-4. But I could go the other way, too.",True,,1518601281.0,1518572481.0,,t3_7xd57h,t3_7xd57h,7,0,0
2612,du7rbks,7xd57h,t5_3f8vd,3,ottcity321,,False,t1_du7rbks,"My best advice to you is to always do what's best for you.  In your case this means taking the permanent cr4 over the ""maybe one day you will be a permanent as1"".  Waiting for three years to roll over into permanent isn't the best strategy in my opinion.  Many things can happen in those three years and circumstances may change, managers may change, and governments may change.  What is said today by a manager may not apply in the future.

Unfortunately, in the government there is always a lot of talk from managers.  Often times they will hype these type of these things in the effort to keep you.  They can say and promise permanency but unless it's on paper, their talk doesn't mean much.  Keep in mind that managers are looking after their own interests and not necessarily yours.  Understand this early on and you will go ahead in your public service career rather quickly and effortlessly. 

I understand the AS1 might be tempting.  But first focus on becoming permanent.   Take the permanent job.  There are so many AS positions in the government, so it shouldn't be too hard to jump over into an AS position from a CR position.  

Also, by you taking the CR4 permanent job this will give you the upper hand in some way.  What I mean to say is if the AS1 department really doesn't want to lose you, they will find some way to offer you a permanent position (whether its a cr or as position).  You want permanency and have to mean it!  When manager see that you are serious and mean business, they will take you much more seriously.  I have seen managers jump mountains just to keep staff that they value and want to keep around.

Point of this all, your strategy should first be becoming permanent then you can focus career progression.

After working there for a year, I was offered an NCR job with another department and took the promotion. Having worked in both environments (from a sleepy corner of an army base in the middle of nowhere, to the national headquarters of a major department), I think I have some insight here.

**Preface**: the vast majority of people I worked with at Shilo were dedicated public servants who often made heroic efforts to do the job properly, despite being under-resourced, understaffed, underfunded and structurally neglected in other ways.

In particular, I had the tremendous fortune to spend that formative year as a public servant with the most incredible supervisor in the whole government. (I'm sorry, I know this will shock some of you, but however good your supervisor is, mine was at least 20% better.) I've never met anyone so tirelessly and relentlessly dedicated to doing the right thing in the right way for the right reasons, more focused on protecting and wisely utilizing taxpayer funds and resources, more invested in the well-being of her coworkers, and more willing to go out on a limb for the sake of doing the right thing. If I grow up to be half the public servant she is, I'll consider my career a success.

But in general, I had an amazing team who taught me a ton, made me feel welcome and engaged in a world which was still totally new to me, made sure I got taken care of, and laughed at my dumb jokes. I was lucky to have the opportunity I got, an if certain things unrelated to the job had gone differently, I would still happily be there today.

-----

Okay, now for the career-limiting disclosures.

There are three key things you need to know about working as a civilian within DND:

**First**, within DND, the Chain of Command is **everything**. When you work on a military base, regardless of what you do or where you do it or who your manager is, all of your work will eventually have to bear the scrutiny of someone in green.

This has some advantages. For one thing, if you run into the common problem of having to wear four different hats for six different supervisors, having the Chain of Command around means you've always got a tiebreaker: if Mary says ""go left"", and Mark says ""go right"", and the Major says ""stand right where you are and jump"", then you jump, and you tell Mary and Mark to take it up with the Major. Sorted.

Another advantage is that your work, regardless of how esoteric it may be, will always be tied directly into the mission of the Canadian Forces. A lot of public servants sit in cubicles and push numbers around all day and never get to see any of their work make a difference. This is not a problem you'll have on a military base: even if you spend the whole day in a spreadsheet, that spreadsheet leads directly to the activities going on outside your office window: your work will matter in obvious and significant ways.

But there are downsides, starting with point two.

-----

**Two**: Most uniformed personnel get turned over every three years. If they do a good job and are on their best behaviour, they can get reassigned every eighteen months as they pinball their way up the ranks -- but most make it to three years and get rotated to a new position on a different base.

This is a tremendous contrast to the civilians.

*Some* civilians are priority spouses: they're married to a service member, and when that member gets reassigned, they go with them, using spousal priority to get a job at the other end. (Which also means that, like the uniformed personnel, they disappear to a new base every three years.)

*Most* civilians, especially in rural areas, are lifers: not only are they career public servants, but they've spent the last 27 years on this very base doing this very job. (Or maybe going from a Junior Beadle to a Beadle to a Supervising Beadle, but still basically doing the same work.)

And this relationship has some pretty heavy implications. For one thing, even if you have a civilian manager and a civilian supervisor, you're still within the Chain of Command, and you will still have a Big Boss in a uniform. He or she will only ever last three years. This means that systems and expectations can shift rapidly and significantly -- in theory. In practice, the fact that most civilians stick around forever dictates that, when the Big Boss tries to change things, the civilians often just shrug. After all, he'll be gone in a year and a half, so if we just do a shitty job of implementing this new approach, we can stonewall him until he gives up, then we can impose on the new guy to go back to the way it was always done. (And what's he gonna do, fire me?) These relationships can get very toxic, and it's a blind spot for the civilians in particular: in some ways it embodies the worst things people say about the public service. (Bureaucrats who stifle change, demand to have things done their own way, and lay down their tools at the merest suggestion of a new approach.)

It also means that sometimes the uniformed people end up doing jobs they aren't really qualified or interested in doing. Especially in technical or specialist settings, it's not unusual to find a team of subject-matter-expert civilians being supervised by a uniformed guy who doesn't have a clue what any of it means. In that situation, at best you get a Smiling Guy who doesn't really understand the work, but means well, and stays out of the way, and trusts his people to do a good job while he just stays in his office and signs the papers. (Or, rather, stamps the papers. I'll explain in a bit.); at worst, you get uniformed people who actively resent being made to do work they find frustrating or which they consider menial or beyond their ken. 

Finally, it can mean that civilians wind up being supervised by uniformed personnel who don't really know *how* to supervise civilians: people who've spent their whole careers ordering soldiers around, and suddenly they find themselves surrounded by office workers in hoodies and jeans who expect things like coffee breaks and sick leave and to be allowed to depart on time even if the job isn't done.

The truth of the matter, and something which gets drilled into new staff at orientation, is that service members sign up for an extremely challenging and demanding responsibility which transcends the difficulty or complexity of any individual task or role. The demands routinely made of service members are almost unthinkable to civilian employees: the example I kept hearing is that, if your Sergeant literally tells a uniformed member to throw themselves on a land mine, they're pretty much obligated to do it. Civilians, with our collective agreements and above-average working conditions, inhabit a completely different world.

It gets especially frustrating in situations where you, as a civilian, are in the minority within your workgroup -- especially if you do the same tasks as uniformed personnel. (Which is quite common in maintenance, motor pool and healthcare settings: you'll literally be working shoulder to shoulder with uniformed personnel, doing the exact same work.) From what I've heard, this can get especially bad in medical centres and dental clinics, particularly for women in clerical and administrative roles. Conversely, if you work in a more mixed environment, things tend to cut in the other direction altogether, where the uniformed people get treated like civilians. In my workplace, which was about 90% civilian, we actually had a reputation as the best place for uniformed people to work, simply because they were held to civilian standards and afforded certain civilian privileges by virtue of being surrounded by civilians.

I really do want to emphasize that it's not all toxic. My workplace was resoundingly healthy, by far the healthiest environment I'd ever worked in. Because, after all, that culture clash also has upsides if you manage it properly: the civilian with 24 years of experience can coach and mentor the newbie in a uniform; the young man in the uniform (strong and vigorous and in the prime of life) can take on different tasks from the old civilian fart who's two years from retirement; the guy in the uniform just posted in from CFB Esquimalt, where they do things completely differently, and talking that out with the civilian who's been working at Cold Lake since the Mulroney administration can be good for both of them; etc. etc. etc.",True,,1518258394.0,1518229594.0,,t3_7whjk2,t3_7whjk2,24,0,0

Perhaps you need to re-evaluate your work situation.  Is it the workload, the coworkers, the hours, etc? If you moved into another position, would it fix the problem, or would it be the same? Will a short stint away from the office (sick leave) rejuvenate you to continue when you return, or will it be resolved? Not to play devils advocate here, but I've witnessed too many coworkers and managers take stress leave in the past few years to the point of abusing the option. It's like a new public service fad, or entitlement to take time off. They come back and the work and stresses haven't changed, so a year or two later, they're off again for another few months.  What I'm getting at is the leave may not be the solution you're looking for or need.  Perhaps it could allow you to self reflect and decide the next steps on your path forward to personal health.

There are two kind of women staffers in the cabinets  ""the wives/girlfriends/daughters"" of important campaign contributers/party workers  and everyone else.  Obviously no one acts in an innapropriate way with the 1st group since they are someone's protégé.   As for the 2nd beleive me some of these girls are ready to do anything to get the job or get promoted.  And yes, if they can,  they do capitalize on their looks to get ahead.  There are a lot of girls with communication degrees and not enough well paid jobs....

(P.S.  It's the same with men, some are protected by their family connections, some are more expandable. The 2nd ones are not hit on by male colleagues  but generally have to work more for less money...)

What's trully ""wonderful"" with cabinets is that ""anyone"" can have ""any role""  and the salary is to the discression of the elected official (and pressure he gets from the party/PMO/someone who vouches for the candidate).   Remember a staffer can be paid from 0$ up to AS-8....

Hiring procedures are extremely informal,   HR departement is inexistant,  and you can be dismessed/promoted for right or wrong reasons.

Abuse  towards staff (from superiors) and between colleagues is rampant and everyone is pretty much for themsleves, despite the offical display party loyalty.   If you think your office politics are bad,  cabinet is 10 times worse.  If you ask any staffer about this, they'll obviously deny that toxic atmosphere exists.

The woman in the article knew and knows all of this, she worked in politics before,  she knows a lot of lobbyists and staffers in the provincial and federal goverment, not knowing who Gagné is when you're from the Quebec liberals is impossible. 

So in short, she was ready to put up with the innapropriate remarks as long as she would get the job.  
But she didn't, so we get to read her rant about ""the toxic culture"" which she endures and keeps enduring by the way while working for a provincial MP.

No it's not professional in anyway, and i hope this situation is a lesson for everyone who works or aspires to work in poltics.  No I don't think you should lose your job if you messaged someone on fb to compliment her on her body, and no that doesn't qualify as sexual agression, maybe Gagné did other things, but then why did his superiors looked the other way.

I think the public service is overall a good place to be in terms of resolving most difficult work-place scenarios, but suffers when it comes to ""official"" complaints over unhealthy work environment, with complainants being seen as ""whiners"" or not ""team players.""

Having said this, I would strongly recommend simply leaving your team and look religiously for other opportuities - apply for internal postings, look for deployment opportunities on GCConnex, or network outside your dept. 

I was a term in my old department with a director that would consistently berate me and my team members, and overall created a very unhealthy and demoralizing work environment.

I have heard of differential treatment by unions of term employees vs indeterminate employees. Nominally, theyre supposed to have your back just as much as they do indeterminate employees but they actively complain about departments using term employees to fill boxes that should otherwise go to indeterminate employees and Ive heard very different things about how term employees are treated by unions vs indeterminate employees. Tread carefully if you do decide to proceed and dont assume anyone is on your side. I know thats cynical but the system is fucked and you need to watch out for yourself above all else.

If it were me, I would do everything I can to move to a different team as soon as possible. Deploying to another division or department at-level would be the fastest way to accomplish this. Use GCConnex, reach out to previous supervisors, ask friends, coldcall, etc. If its as uncomfortable as you say, you should want out of there as soon as you can. If you do decide to proceed with a formal complaint, I actually think youd be able to do it better from a place of safety in a division that does not involve your toxic boss and at a pace and in a manner that you decide rather than doing it with the pressure of working alongside someone youre actively lodging an official complaint against.

I suggest separating in your mind the information that's in Peoplesoft, and what you are actually entitled to for leave credits. Your leave entitlements are available to you *no matter what is listed in Peoplesoft*. Start tracking them yourself, using an Excel spreadsheet or on paper. Start with the balances from your previous department, and then add vacation leave on a month-by-month basis based on what you'd be entitled under your collective agreement (adjusting upward for the month in which your 8th anniversary of service occurs). Treat this as a 'shadow' tracking system and ignore what's in Peoplesoft for now. 

Show the spreadsheet to your manager, and use that to determine what you have available on a month-to-month basis. As you take vacation leave, deduct from your shadow spreadsheet. 

From now until the Pay Centre gets to your request, use the 'shadow' system to track your leave credits and debits. It's a pain in the butt, but it'll give you what you (and your manager) need to ensure that the Peoplesoft system is updated correctly whenever Pay Centre gets to your request.

For a time it was in vogue around here to try to get your union leadership to hand-deliver your pay file to the minister of public works.

First. I'd double check what you applied for, as I am about 95% sure it's not for a *permanent* position as a Telephone Interviewer. Indeterminate exists, but not for new hires.

Second, you *can* apply for internal jobs once you're hired. You'll be hired under the Statistics Act, yes, and you don't actually have a ""real"" classification, but you're still eligible to apply and get internal jobs.

Upward movement... Yeah, it's not great. You can become a supervisor relatively easy depending on openings, and then from there a spot in management is possible, but not too likely. In a couple years when next census starts up, then openings are likely (or you'll have a good shot to go to census maybe), but otherwise it's unlikely. The number of managers is unlikely to go up, so unless one of them leaves, a spot won't be opening.

Work environment is what you make of it. I don't know which office you mean when you say West (there are two) so I couldn't comment directly. The work itself is pretty easy if you're an outgoing person and won't take what some members of the public say to heart. You'll get yelled at and sworn at on the phone - that's inevitable, but honestly, it depends on you and how that affects you. You'll also get to talk to a lot of really interesting people and if you care about your work, it can be meaningful.

Hours can vary enormously. Are you bilingual? You'll almost be guaranteed work if you are. If not, depends what that office is hiring for. You could work full time for two weeks, then have nothing for a month. You could work ten days out of a month and that's it. Or it could be almost full time for months...then back to one week a month.

As I said before, you *can* get indeterminate, but it's not simple. The ""after three years automatically"" does not apply. The only possibility is when an indeterminate process is run, and then there are usually qualifications. One of those usually being worked there for x-yeara.

1. Have an open-door policy for all the employees. My former director was very uh.... formal and you could only meet after meeting with your immediate supervisor in regards to concerns and goals. Plus the director would ask why you are meeting and if you spoke with your manager about the concerns. Unless you were a higher level, you could not just talk with the director casually; you had to ""follow your channel"" It made the director intimidating and uninterested in your concerns. So I would suggest you make sure all the employees can just walk into your office to discuss concerns(when you are not busy of course!)

2. Invest in your employees! My old director would rather deploy random analysts into the team instead of investing in those who were already there. It made those employees unhappy and their work performance suffered cause they did not feel valued. Provide acting opportunities and promote those who did their competitions successfully in order to retain experience and talent!

3. Be honest with your employees and treat them like people. I am sorry if this sounds obvious but my experience with other directors were not so great. When I asked for opportunities they would make lies up and excuses and it made me feel like garbage.. If you can't provide an opportunity to an employee tell that person why and that you would love to when the chance comes up. I can tell you if I heard that my morale would be so high! Also, ask how your employees are doing and tell them they are doing a great job. It really does help!

Communicate clearly, repeatedly, and remember that most people won't bother reading your emails (especially when they're sent to the entire division/branch/etc). 

Let the managers who work for you do their jobs without direct interference. Provide a shit umbrella from above, and help bring concerns from below up to your boss. 

Ask for help. HR, Finance, and all the other internal services are there to help you. 

Plus, keep asking these kinds of questions. They're what make you a good manager.

* My first piece of advice is delegate and get comfortable doing so! You will get flooded with HR tasks, financial tasks, random emergencies and whatever your DG may be delegating to you. You will not have enough hours in a week to get through it all. Things run so smoothly when tasks that can/should be delegated to managers, are! I know sometimes my director feels bad delegating, whether it be because she feels like she's overworking the managers or feels as if she's being lazy for not doing it herself, but the reality is she's just as overworked and there has to be a balance. 

* Establish a good relationship with your EA (I hope you have a good one!). This may be a little biased, but I have an exceptional relationship with my director and that has caused me to having an exceptional relationship with the managers as well. This means that often, I am able to get the managers or even team leaders on tasks even before the director even sees it, which again, frees up time for your more pressing tasks. Find out what works for you, what you would like, schedule a weekly bilat with your EA if necessary. A few pointers that help us run smoothly here are:

1. having a printout of the daily calendar in the AM

2. having a in box for signatures, and an out box so that your EA can just go distribute them once they are signed

3. having a ""knock policy"" which means I go an knock 5 minutes before a meeting is supposed to end so that meetings don't run long and mess up the agenda for the day (obviously not when it's a high-level meeting)

4. if you are visual, get important emails printed for you, if not, have some categories on outlook so that your EA can mark more pressing emails for you to look at them (i.e ""for action"", ""for review"" etc.)  






* Have monthly, or biweekly if possible, team meetings. This (to me at least) shows the team you care and you are making time to hear them out. Have your agenda with your items and then allow enough time for a round table for the whole team to have a chance to speak.

* This was mentioned already but open door policy is a big one. The last thing you want is people being scared of coming to you with any concerns or problems.

* This was also mentioned, but investing in your team is huge. We have a developmental program here that has been working great and it creates incentive for our team to work even harder, and towards a goal. 

* This may seem small but, when you have a new hire, no matter the level, do the walk around and introduce them. Even if you did not hire them directly, it sets the tone for that person and they will know feel more comfortable approaching you. 

* Have a good social committee and be involved with them! My director stays in the loop and suggests ideas every so often for activities and team building. It makes a big difference and she never misses an activity which, again, shows the team you care. 

* Block yourself 30 minutes a day if you can to do any pressing HR/Finance/Signatures/Email cleanup. It helps tremendously!

* Something that helps have a smooth running day here without having to book a ton of small meetings is having a ""daily"" : 15 to 30 minutes either every day or 2-3 times a week to talk to the managers first thing in the morning so that everyone is on the same page.

* EAT LUNCH! Block that time in your calendar!

* One of the biggest things that I noticed keeps the team happy is acknowledgement. Whether it be an email or in passing, receiving praise for good work on a big issue or just in general is very much appreciated by everyone.

* Set a daily calendar reminder 30 minutes before you should leave the office. Don't overwork yourself! You stay happy, and it's highly likely you'll be able to keep your team happy :)

I just left a job with the best director I have had to date. From the moment he walked in the door, I knew it was going to be good. I was on my way out the door. I had lined up an at-level secondment with a category change to get me going down a different path, but not necessarily the one I wanted. I stayed put because I could tell I could learn a lot from him. 

Some of the things he did/does: 

1) Take an interest in your colleagues and your team. Their wants, their aspirations. I'd been stuck in a role that I wasn't jazzed about for a variety of reasons. The second day he was there he told me ""I am sure you are competent, but you don't belong here. My goal is to get you to where you want to go on your path."" He came in June, and by November, I switched categories and am in a job two levels higher. 

2) Allow them opportunities to spread their wings. This doesn't have to mean expensive training, this could just mean, ""Hey. Do you want to try your hand at this task?"" or ""Do you want to sit in on this meeting to get more contextual information?"" Within reason, of course, but what he pulled me into was always super interesting, and he took the time to debrief with me afterwards. 

3) Lead by example. He really walked the walk and talked the talk. He was super concerned about making sure everything was on the up and up, and ""doing the right thing"", but also to create and promote a good work/life balance by enabling us to take time during the week to attend to health. (We were co-located with DND, so that was something they had and he provided it to us too, while attending to his own stuff.)

I was in a very similar situation as you about a year ago. My academic background is in political science. I had previous experiences working in parliament, NGOs/non-profits, and with academic research, all at the assistant/intern level. My first job in government was a casual PM-01 contract but I always knew from the beginning that I was overqualified for the PM-01 and that I wanted a policy job. It took me about a year after being hired into the government to get my current position as a policy advisor (EC-04).

I think it's great that you got a job in the federal government. Honestly, any government job helps to get your foot in the door first because it will allow you time to gain the prerequisites you need to get the policy job you want. 

First, you should aim to get BBB in your second language assessments. Many policy jobs require BBB and if you want to keep moving up, you'll want to eventually get CBC or CCC (depending on how high you want to go/what department you want to work at) but BBB is a good start. Ask your immediate supervisor if they can put you through for second language testing. If your immediate supervisor says no, find another way. Apply for any jobs that you can that require BBB even if you don't want the job because if they'll put you through for the language tests, you can use those results for any future jobs you would want. 

Second, get your secret clearance. Again, this is not essential for all policy jobs in all departments but it opens more doors, especially for departments like defense, public safety, RCMP, CBSA, immigration, global affairs, etc. where secret clearance is most likely required. Again, ask your supervisor if they're willing to put you through for secret clearance. If they say no, do the same as above and apply for any jobs that require secret clearance so they'll put you through for the clearance if they're seriously considering your candidacy. 

Third, cold-call anyone you might want to work for or who might put you through for language testing and/or secret clearance. You already have policy experience, even if it's not in government. That's valuable. The division that initially hired me as a PM-01 didn't want to put me through for language testing or secret clearance. So I cold-called/emailed every Assistant Director/Deputy Director (don't email Directors, they have very little to do with making hiring decisions) of the various divisions in my branch asking if they were looking for a PM-03 or equivalent employee (I know it sounds crazy but I figured I had nothing to lose) and wrote a bullet-point summary of my qualifications with specific reasons of why I wanted to work for their division. I also tailored my resume to suit what I thought they would want to see in a prospective candidate. I used the department Intranet to look up descriptions of each division as well as the department's organizational chart so that I can better tailor my brief cover letter in my cold-calls/emails. I also cold-called divisions in other departments doing similar work. Most ignored me. Some were kind and said they'd pass my resume along or they had informal meetings with me giving me advice or trying to see if there could be a fit in their team. One asked me if I'd be interested in a PM-02 position and asked if I had my BBB and secret clearance. I said no but they put me through for language testing and secret clearance anyway because they were interested in hiring me. The process of language testing and secret clearance took 2-3 months to complete. In the end, I decided I didn't want to work for that division but I had my BBB and my secret clearance in hand, which was the most important part of this process. You don't need everyone to be clamoring to hire you. Most will ignore you. You just need ONE to put you through for language testing and secret clearance and you're golden. 

After I got my BBB and my secret clearance, I did another round of cold-calling/emailing with the customized resumes/brief cover letters. Again, most ignored me. Some were kind. I had a couple of interviews with others. One was looking for an EC-04 Policy Advisor right away and asked me to come in for an interview as they happened to be interviewing candidates that week. I did really well at the interview. They asked for my references. My references were both extremely positive. I got hired a few weeks later. I think I also had a competitive edge as the job required BBB and secret clearance and they needed someone to start RIGHT AWAY. I already had it so they didn't have to wait for any of that to come through. I was a term employee at my home division at this point. This new job was at a different department and they did a non-advertised process to hire me at the higher level.

Don't let people convince you that you should wait your turn and spend hours applying for advertised processes and hope to get selected into a pool and then eventually hired a year later when they decide to pull you out because it's the only ""right"" way to do things. Don't let people convince you that you should only aim for ""reasonable"" jumps like a level or two above. That's just ONE way to get the job you want in the public service. There are always other ways. There's always a side door, a side window, a garage, etc. Be relentless (but always polite and gracious as well) and don't be afraid to ask for what you really want. Like I said, most people will ignore you. But that's okay. Success is hard-work, talent/skill, and opportunity/luck. You have the talent/skill (based on your previous experiences), you can put in the hard work to do the networking/cold-calling/outreach that you need to do, and you just need to meet the right opportunity. If you keep trying and you keep asking, you will. But you'll never get there if you don't try and if you don't make the ask.

And don't worry about having started at your job so soon. All of the things I described above take TIME. Get started now as this process will take time to bear fruit. You can still put the job description of your current position on your resume. It is your job, right? And by the time you get your BBB, your secret clearance, and hear back from the people you've cold-called, you'll have been doing that job for a few months.

We prioritize non-competitive processes right now: student-bridging (hiring a former student), appointments (promotions without advertisement or competition) and deployments (stealing people at level from other departments), in roughly that order of preference. An attempt was made at creating some pools about 18 months ago, but that has been widely seen as a failure because of some very ill-advised assessment tools used in those processes. Pools, in my experience, turn out to be not much of a time saver as the hiring manager's portion of the time is not the rate limiting step.

This situation is currently awful, the worst I've seen in my two decades in the service. There are many, many issues with the HR system, and I can't see that changing soon.

Be passionate about a subject (preferably work-related), and learn all the specialized vocabulary related to it, and practice forming grammatically-sound sentences to describe it.

It also depends on your tenure (term/indeterminate) and years of service. As a long-term indeterminate employee with a good manager, I'm comfortable telling my boss that I don't really want to share details of my health issues, so ""I am not feeling well and won't be in today"" is the extent of it. I don't think it sounds ""fake"" at all - as long as it's an honest assessment of your current state of health.

I have several hundred hours of sick time banked, and am careful to only use the leave when I'm actually sick, so that helps. I don't worry about using the leave, though - that is what it is for, after all. 

Ditto for family-related items. Some people will use every hour that's available, other people won't use it at all. I've had a combination of elderly parents with health issues and small children for the past several years, so my family-related leave is typically used up by January with sick children, bringing parents to medical appointments, and so on. 

As to vacation, it's supposed to be used in the year that it's earned. So do that. Getting some R&R is good for your mind, body, and soul, and makes you a better employee when you get back to work.

Collective agreements limit the amount of vacation time that can roll-over between years, and the excess (I think 7 weeks in all agreements now) is cashed out.  Cash-outs, however, require separate accounting within managers' budgets, so instead they're more likely to order you to take vacation time.  That's within their rights (most/all agreements also allow the employer to schedule vacation time), but probably not what you want.

From 2015 to 2016, the EX population increased by 0.85%, from 6,360 to 6,414.  Then add in the 1.25% increase that the unionized employees received and you reach roughly 2.1% accounting for both population growth and inflation.

3.2% [total spending increase] - 2.1% [population growth and inflationary increase]= 0.85%

So now we're only looking at a 0.85% increase in executive bonuses compared to the unionized employees.

I scored 5/5 on each of the competencies (a perfect score) so I guess I did the assessment the way that they wanted me to.  

My tips: 

* The assessment is *long*. The time allotted is 3.25 hours, and when I wrote it I needed every minute of it. You will be doing a LOT of writing, and when I did it it was entirely using pen-and-paper (my hand is cramping up just recalling the experience). 

* [Read the test description](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/services/staffing-assessment-tools-resources/human-resources-specialists-hiring-managers/human-resources-toolbox/personnel-psychology-centre/consultation-test-services/public-service-commission-tests/middle-manager-basket-exercise-820.html). Then read it again and again. Memorize the definitions used for the competencies, because that's what you have to demonstrate. 

* The entire assessment was done *in writing*. Basically I sat down in a room, was given the test package, and I spent the next three hours reading and writing. If you are a slow reader or can't keep multiple items organized in your head, you will have difficulty. I kept some scrap paper nearby to jot down notes on all of the materials. By the end, I had things written everywhere - some on the items that they gave me as part of the package, some on separate sheets of paper, but almost everything had some kind of note on it. 

* Treat the exercise as if you were a manager working in 1960, and computers haven't entered the workplace. Everything is communicated by written memos, and every decision you make has to be done *in writing*. For each item you deal with, there should be a paper trail.

* Delegating is one of the competencies that you are being assessed on. That means that you don't need to take direct action on every item. You can (and should) delegate items to your assistant, other employees, etc. If you delegate, *following up* is part of the competency. This could be as simple as ""Please set up a meeting with Bob within the next week, and send me a note once you've done that. I will follow up with you on Friday if I haven't heard from you by then"". 

* For ""planning"" and ""organizing"", you'll note that the competencies require you to be ""orderly"" and ""systematic"". That means you should have a good system in place for your calendar, your to-dos, and your plans for upcoming work. 

* For ""managing programs"", you will need to take steps to ensure the work is done *accurately* and that *policies are followed*. Give some thought to how you might express that in writing and what systems you might put in place to ensure quality/compliant work.

In your example, the manager could choose to pursue the deployment and deploy the individual into a vacant position, and still continue with the advertised process to create a pool for other vacancies.

(Disclaimer: The below applies to GAC FS positions. IRCC has a somewhat similar but different process for their FS processes).

The external FS competition that runs some, but not all, years as part of the Post-Secondary Recruitment campaign in the Fall is literally, by number of applicants to positions available, the MOST competitive regular competition for a Government of Canada job. As in thousands of people apply for what may only be 10 to 20 positions (maybe less).

Bare minimums for background include a CCC second language profile (so quite fluently bilingual) and some form of post-secondary degree. They often throw in several asset criteria as well which can include graduate degrees, specific degrees, various types of work experience and durations etc.

You need to complete the application with all of the above.

You need to write and do reasonably well on the Public Service Entrance Exam.

Even if you do the above, they sometimes use random selection to ween down the number of candidates to a manageable level so your process may end here, at no fault of your own.

You need to write and do fairly well on the Intercultural Adaptation Assessment.

You need to do at least an individual, if not also a group, interview and do quite well on that.

You need to do the Second Language Evaluations for Reading, for Writing, and for Oral and get C or E in them all (unless you have valid scores already).

You need your references to check out.

You need to get your Top Secret (Level III) clearance.

Once all that is done, you can be appointed. But that is a lot to do, it often takes well over a year to all happen, and GAC's HR are renowned for just screwing it up and processes going no where. But the next chance to apply will be October 2018, maybe (they may not run the competition in 2018, they didn't in 2017). I think I recall the average age of people appointed to FS jobs being in the 30s.

As for non-FS classifications that work abroad, generally those people have jobs in Canada and take the postings abroad for a specific duration. They can work for departments that are not GAC as well, depending on the issue. There are not really many non-locally engaged staff postings abroad for non-FS employees.

The system which was initially put in place to be fair and transparent has become too inflexible for the modern day workplace - yes, even within bureaucracies. Based on current practices, managers and directors can only justify hiring someone based on what is presented within the scope of the formal competition and formal reference checks. 

For example, the reference request is usually for your immediate supervisor and manager *only*. Yet, your manager and supervisor only see you for a few minutes a week and have limited insight into your personality and day-to-day work. There seems to be no flexibility to present other more useful references: clients, project teams, and other stakeholders who interact and engage with you on a daily basis. Furthermore, if your manager and/or supervisors see you as a workhorse and don't want to let you go, will they have enough integrity and maturity to provide a good reference? 

Individuals who end up filing grievances or are left feeling confused as to why they weren't chosen, despite stellar references, is largely due to these outside conversations. It would almost be better to adopt private sector practices of hiring and promotions; this way employees don't suffer from cognitive dissonance and the illusion that everything is fair and transparent. There would be a significant reduction in administrative paperwork for managers, HR etc., because let's be honest, at the end of the day management will find a way to choose whomever they want.

Some stats on new executives (2017 numbers) that should help answer your question: 

* Roughly 500 or so executives were appointed (consistent for last few years)
* less than 30% are under the age of 40. Most (50%) are between 40-49. 
* 83% have more than 10 years of experience in the federal public service. 
* 33% came from the EC classification, with AS (10%) and PM (8%) a distant second and third.
* Fewer moves appear to be better. 27% of new executives have only worked in one department. 25% worked in two, and 23% worked in 3. Lots of moves brought down chances. only 13% had worked in 4 departments and 5 or more departments was 11%.
* There is gender parity, 52% of new executives are female.
* 93% have a bachelors degree and 53% have a masters.

It's also worth noting the [2015 Demographic Profile of Executives](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/human-resources-statistics/demographic-snapshot-federal-public-service-2015.html#fig13). Only 0.8% of federal government executives are under the age of 34. That means there are about 50 of us. 

So based on the stats, the profile of a candidate most likely to become an executive is:

* At least 40 years old
* Has a university education
* Has worked in the public service at least 10 years (but more likely 15-20)
* Has worked in 3 departments or less
* Works in the EC classification

I've just started applying for EX 01 posters, I'm 35,and have 16yrs experience. I just didn't want to do management until I got thrust into it, and turns out I like it (go figure). I'm hoping to land an EX 01 in the next couple years, but no huge rush.

Overpayments and tax season
 

As we enter the 2017 tax filing season, the registration of overpayments in Phoenix will be critical to ensuring employees avoid tax issues and maintain their eligibility for important social benefits. If you were overpaid and did not receive a letter from the Pay Centre, you must call the Contact Centre at 1-855-686-4729 by January 19, 2018. This will ensure that your overpayment is registered in Phoenix.

The Pay Centre is working hard to process registered overpayments by the end of January 2018. This will ensure that T4 and Relevé 1 slips will reflect the correct salary of employees. This will also mean that those with an overpayment will only be required to repay the net amount received. The Pay Centre will confirm this information in writing once the overpayment is processed.

The Pay Centre will work with you to confirm a flexible repayment plan that best suits your needs. If your overpayment is not registered by January 31, 2018, you will have to repay the gross amount. However, you will not need to make any repayments until July 2018, after your tax account has been credited with an amount equal to the difference between the net and gross overpayment. This will ensure that no one is out of pocket as a result of an overpayment.

Finally, we would like to remind you that it is important that you file your 2017 tax return before the April 30, 2018, deadline to maintain your eligibility for certain benefits and credits.

If you want to learn more about overpayments and tax filing season, we invite you to consult these new dedicated web pages.

3. Have you spoken to him about your interest in moving up? Don't whine or make accusations. Just like ""Hey,  I'm interested in moving up. Think I'm a good candidate?"" or ""I know X position is vacant. Would you consider acting me up into it, for four months to see how it goes?"". If the answers are negative, ask if there is anything you can do to change his mind. If not, just GTFO and find a new place to work. File a complaint after you have a LOO for a new job in hand. 


4. Please consider the above before reporting this or talking about it further with colleagues. It's terrible for him and it could get you labelled as a troublemaker.

1. Even ""winning"" doesn't necessarily guarantee you a promotion. If you can show that someone else was promoted *unfairly* and that you should have been promoted instead, you might be able to bump them out -- but if you just illustrate broad bias in need of correction but without showing that any individual process was so egregiously biased as to merit undoing, you might not get anything material to show for it.
2. You're almost certainly gonna piss people off no matter how you pursue it. Some people will resent you ""fiddling"" with ""their"" decisions. Some will view you as a threat. (You are, after all, trying to bump others out of their ""rightful"" promotions...) And insofar as you'd be walking into any promotion with ""EQUITY HIRE"" stamped on your forehead, there are workplaces where people would resent you for it. (They shouldn't. It's dumb. It's racist. But it happens.)
3. Racial and gender bias in hiring and promotion often reflect broader attitudes and biases. If this is the case in your workplace, then getting ahead -- particularly if you do it by ""making a fuss"" and ""creating problems"" for the people in charge -- may actually put you in a more vulnerable situation. The broader environment in your workgroup won't necessarily improve just because you fix one staffing process: often people feel chastened and ashamed, but instead of turning to introspection and thinking about their role in the situation, prefer to blame the complainant for ""stirring up drama"" and ""playing the [race/gender] card"". It's disgusting, but it happens.

None of this means that you shouldn't pull the trigger. If you were wrongly denied a promotion because your bosses are biased and making poor decisions as a result, then you should absolutely talk to the union and document stuff and start working up a grievance. Even if you don't necessarily get your rightful promotion, you're reminding your boss that they can't treat people this way, that the bulk of the bureaucracy is on your side, and that -- regardless of their own biases and feelings -- they need to follow the rules. That's all worth doing.

But there's a fuller picture here than you pulling that trigger and getting a promotion three months later. You might not get it. You might find you don't like it. You might get drummed out by a boss who now resents you even more. And you might be happier and better off looking for an exit to a workgroup where the people treat you right.

""is it true that managers have this huge fear of being accused of racism""

this is actually a broader issue in the Western world. People are being accused of being racists, homophobic, sexist, etc., when in reality they simply do not abide with the extremists views on some topics (from the left-wing ultra feminists to the gun lovers religious right). This has lead to an extreme level of political correctness that is now the Achilles heel of the Western civilization and is being abused by countries like Russia (see what they did with the US election by organizing demonstration as fake left-wing and right-wing groups to create trouble).

So back to your topic. I truly doubt anyone would give you a promotion based on a complaint that only white men are being promoted. First, you need to win a competition for the promotion and the hiring manager has to demonstrate how the person being promoted is the best fit. Of course, this isn't foolproof, if they have great writing skills and the HR person is lazy, anything goes... Now going around telling people your boss is a racist without evidence would most likely guarantee you would never get promoted, as you would not have good references and these are usually the key for the best-fit documents. So if you think you've been cheated in the past, take a look at your previous references, sometimes it wasn't necessarily bad and wasn't enough to disqualify you from a process, but something that was mentioned during the conversation may influence a hiring manager to go with someone else.

Or maybe every time you applied to a competition you were good, but there were better candidates out there. In those cases, ask for debriefs and work on what you get. If the debrief is useless, ask for more information and mention that the intent is not to fight their decision, but know what to improve.

There may still be a bias against you, I don't know which ethnic origin you are and if you wear visible religious gear, but these could be perceived negatively in an environment where most people are educated and being religious in general is somewhat seen as a sign of poor judgement and potential trouble (e.g. some groups that have clearly abused the religious discrimination and reasonable accommodation protection in the Constitution).

I worked for almost 5 years at GAC back when it was still called DFAIT and then DFATD. I worked with Trade Commissioners, Geographics (Politics), Consular Affairs, and Information / Web services.  All through temp help agencies, one FSWEP/coop, a casual, a term, and as a contractor (where I would bill my hours myself to the department). 

Although I really liked my experiences overall and met some wonderful people, and I'm thankful for the work experience it provided me, at times I also experienced a toxic workplace there, and some people actively contributing to that toxic environment. I mean people lying to each other and spreading rumors behind your back to improve their chances at being bridged (or lowering yours), to improve their standing in competitions for acting positions (or to harm yours), people intentionally withholding information from other divisions within the department to make their division look good and the other one less competent, divisions claiming their will cooperate with yours and then not, and so on.... Things you'd expect to see in a high school setting, but happening at a professional level.  I don't want to get into specifics, but yeah, I've seen it happen over & over again. 

This kind of thing happens in every work environment, but having worked for several other departments (Including Employment and Social Development Canada, Service Canada, and Innovation, Science and Economic Development), I can objectively say that it's particularly worse at GAC. Perhaps because people there are much more competitive when it comes to career advancement than in other departments? I'm not sure. But it came to a point where I didn't feel like applying to GAC's postsecondary recruitment process anymore. 

It's a shame because there are wonderful people working at Global Affairs who truly love what they do, and the work experience opportunities there can be amazing, but more than a few bad apples are spoiling it department-wide from what I experienced.

Now, having been in the PS a few years and also some observations from talking to people and watching some careers, I have some GAC opinions.

1. They are currently quite the shitshow for HR and personnel management. Budget concerns make them very unwilling to commit to indeterminate jobs. That works for them because it seems like there is an endless supply of FSWEP/CO-OP/Casual and some terms to work there (see attitude above).

2. The department has its own culture (so do others), but it is also quite incestuous. People who get into GAC indeterminately rarely leave compared to movement out in other departments. This works against GAC. Their employees, at least in policy type work, get less diverse experiences and knowledge than say an EC who has been around a bit and maybe in a central agency or two.

3. GAC, perhaps by nature of the international studies and development programs attracting certain kinds of people, seems to be pretty partisan compared to the PS at large. Remember video of them all cheering in the lobby of HQ when Dion and co first came in as if they were being liberated from occupation? Most public servants in other departments have a semblance of control, judgment or indifference to avoid doing that kind of thing.

""...on promotion is to be the rate of pay nearest that to which the person was entitled in his or her substantive level immediately before the appointment that gives the person an increase in pay as specified in Subsection 2.2.3 above or an amount equal to at least 4 per cent of the maximum rate of pay for the position to which he or she is appointed when the salary for the position to which the appointment is made is governed by performance pay.""",True,,1514946107.0,1514917307.0,,t3_7nnnh8,t3_7nnnh8,5,0,0

From the T&C of employment, the movement is a promotion if:

>>  [2.2.2.3] the maximum rate of pay applicable to the position to which that person is appointed exceeds the maximum rate of pay applicable to the persons substantive level immediately before the appointment by [...] [2.2.2.3(a)] an amount equal to at least the lowest pay increment for the position to which he or she is appointed, 

The AS-1 maximum rate of pay is $57,643/yr, which is $6,125 higher than CR-4's maximum of $51,518.  The smallest pay increment for AS-1 is $1,960 between the first two steps, so the new appointment is therefore a promotion.

To establish the rate of pay on promotion, turn to the next clause of the T&C:

>> [2.2.2.4] [T]he rate of pay on promotion is to be the rate of pay nearest that to which the person was entitled in his or her substantive level immediately before the appointment that gives the person an increase in pay as specified in Subsection 2.2.3

So, your new rate of pay would need to be at least $53,478, or your current $51,518 plus the $1,960 minimum increment.  That rate of pay is closest to step 2 of AS-01, which is where you should be placed.

You've stumbled upon a manifestation of this phenomenon. In indeterminate public service world, it's not at all unusual for someone to sign a Letter of Offer on their first day of work, and -- by extension -- it's also not unheard-of for public servants who are transferring to a new position or a new department to have open-ended start dates, of the ""we expect a letter of offer to show up sometime between March 14th and the end of April, and we'd like you to start within a day or two of the letter arriving"" variety. (And what's more, if they underestimate the timing and the letter doesn't land until June, that's normal and healthy and your outgoing manager will just deal with it -- and if the process jumps the rails and the letter never shows up at all and the whole thing gets cancelled, your manager will just deal with *that*, too, and you keep your job, and that's that.) Lots of managers quite rightly hate having to deal with the uncertainty and wibbly-wobbliness of this process, but they're contractually obligated to do so (and they also benefit from it in turn), so they put up with it.

But in the real world, your external manager *doesn't* have to accommodate any of it. Some of them will be friendly and civil about it, but others will want you to nail down a date and will hold you to it, even if things pile up with the Letter of Offer or it gets pulled altogether. (So if you agree on a final date of March 13th, and come March 7th you learn that the Letter of Offer won't actually be ready until June... too bad! You're unemployed for a few months. Sorry.)

With that in mind, my recommendations to external applicants are:

1. State plainly that you aren't comfortable resigning from your current position without a signed Letter of Offer in hand.
2. In discussions around start dates, emphasize that you need to give [x] weeks of notice to your employer. For example, ""Yes, June 5th is fine by me -- but do bear in mind that, in all cases, I need to give my employer [x] weeks of notice in advance of my departure, so to make a June 5th start date, I would need a Letter of Offer by May 13th at the latest.""
3. Do nothing to jeopardize your current employment until these criteria are satisfied. Don't mention it to your boss or coworkers, don't drop hints, don't send emails from your corporate account, etc. 

Some public service managers will push back on these tactics, and you may have to decide how much risk you're willing to endure: do you trust the oral offer, are you satisfied that they'll meet the deadline, are you comfortable giving notice on the information available to you, etc. These are judgement calls, and we really can't help you with them.",True,,1514614660.0,1514585860.0,,t3_7mxazm,t3_7mxazm,20,0,0

There is zero accountability for managers and the HR staff they rely on to get the process in order.  So for example, if Karen in HR has a headache for a week and decides to stay home, that letter will sit in purgatory until she decides its important enough to complete.

You can find a full table of the historical contribution rates as a Google Spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hvYmwecFMD3P4aP1lig9HKXhoUKtxLqm9-BpUjrH0qM/edit?usp=sharing

The ""low"" contribution rate (for earnings up to the amount covered by CPP) was 4% of salary from 2001 to 2005, and then started going up.

By 2008, it was 4.9%. In 2012 it was 6.2%, and in 2018 it will be 9.83%. That's nearly double!

The ""high"" rate (for earnings above the CPP maximum) went from 8.40% in 2008 to 12.13% in 2018, a 50% increase!

While I think it's awesome that we have a good pension plan, it's frustrating to see that the amount every employee has been forced to contribute (it's a mandatory pay deduction after all) has gone up by such a large amount, with *no increase in pension benefits*. 

The contribution rates are entirely set by Treasury Board as far as I can tell. Doesn't this mean that every increase in rates is effectively a pay cut? There's less take-home pay available for each employee if the contributions go up, right?

If you just have a spreadsheet for them to update without call letter and reminder coordinated by DGO, it won't work. Some ideas are below:

1. Proper folder structure (shared/GC Doc) that is accessible by directors and their reps is likely the most important:
* organize by year, and within each separate folders for strategic, PMO specific task, ad-hoc requests that will accept response from directors, etc
* shared hot file spreadsheet for projects/strategic item that need to be updated weekly/monthly (call letter coordinated by DGO)
* when a request completed, clean up and move the entire request to archive folder
* call letters for ad-hoc requests should be coordinated by DGO and send to the rep/director/manager with due date: need to be firm on request and reminder
2. Private/restricted shared one-note: for strategic info between directors and DG, meeting minutes, etc. E.g. DGO/DG could simply input agenda for meeting what DG wants to know for the meeting and director will update directly in shared one-note.
3. Use outlook calendar all day event item for reminders

Sometimes if you made it to the best fit interview, it is really a choice between 3-4 candidates and you cannot really get a debrief for that, or at least a useful one. The hiring manager may have someone in mind already but HR requires those best fit forms, so they must meet a few candidates, which is a waste of time for everyone. Sometimes the person may have experience that while not essential for the position, would be an asset (even if not requested on the poster), etc.

And sometimes if you fail the exam or interview, you may simply not have the right experience. This is when the debrief is the most important, because if you failed a question about a specific policy, next time you'll study and most likely get a good score, but if it is something that you can only get through experience, now you can ask your current supervisor to get that experience or do a lateral move. These are not short-term solutions, but we all know people who have moved up without the proper experience and it is never a good thing.

Do those preparation to interview courses. Expand your knowledge, gain different experience. Don't feel entitled, apply to positions you can win and in which you can perform, but don't be afraid to ask for help to get there, and you'll be successful.

After Harpers goverment got defeated  some of them managed to get back in to provincial cabinets in the Couillard Goverment.   

Some staffers end up rotating between federal , provincial and municipal cabinets.  Generally they come from well connected backgrounds. Since it's really a ""who you know"" world.

Pay is an issue, almost all staffers in Quebec felt undepaid.  There is a gap in between Quebec and Canads civil servants and it does show even for exempt employees.

From what i found online the budget of a Quebec cabinet  minister is about 600-700k. (someone who has a more important porfolio, can have 700-800k budget )  Generally a cabinet minister have about dozen people working for him/her.   Substract the cheif of staff that earns 110-130k and  there isn't that much left for everyone else.

Exclusions aka ""policy breeches"" are entirely possible; I do them all the time. We do have flexibility to book hotels and flights, within reason. My management is willing to allow a fairly well defined set of breeches, so this is usually not an issue with staff. We can stay in conference hotels, we can choose flights with shorter layovers or direct routes to save time, for example. 

Short-booking (less than two days before travel) and changes while on travel status are, in fact, easy. Call the HRG line and do it with an operator. In every case I've had to use the phone line, I've found the operators to be very helpful. I'm tempted to do this all the time frankly, but it does cost more than using the web tool.

The mechanics of travel to Europe are not that different to domestic travel. It is very different in terms of the departmental travel plan, and in terms of budgeting, but it's not any more difficult to do in terms of travel arranging. The government MC travel card works great in Europe (and elsewhere). Note that flights to Europe do not qualify as long enough for business class upgrades for most people.

The travel claims are where most of our staff have issues. As an application, HRG expense claims cause very significant problems for all our staff. Error rates are up considerably since it came in as the payment claims process is so incredibly arcane. So, my recommendation to all our staff is to work closely with our travel advisors to get it right. Travel rules are ever-changing as well, which doesn't help.

I travel a half-dozen times a year or so. I used to travel 20+ times a year back in the mid-2000s, but that's cut way back these days, and I can't say I miss it.

My first trip was on one day notice, and only found out about the flight the day of. However, typically you have some time to book flights, hotels and the rest of it. The typical protocol is establish the trip/meeting is happening, prepare a travel authorization form, get that approved, book your flights, then your hotels, complete your initial claim, do the travel, complete the actual costs, and get paid out for your expenses. 


We use HRG for booking of airlines, which is a bit of a pain in the butt to be honest. You can find airlines, and typically it is market pricing, but sometimes there are issues. If you have to call them for support, it is $60 per call. Further to that, using vouchers is a hit or miss scenario, so never build in a voucher into your TAF. 


We book our own hotels (within the city limit calculator as much as we can) and utilise our own cards for food and other expenses. Claims typically take about 25 minutes to complete, and are in your account in less than a week. However, my department is one of the few that does not use HRG for the full process. 


As for your questions, booking flights/hotels is not too bad of a procedure but you need to look around to find some deals. There is some flexibility, as in we normally will fly in the night before to allow for morning meetings or anything like that. I have loved the opportunity to travel, and have now travelled with my Director, DG, ADM and by myself. Each presents its own challenges, but overall the experience has been good. As well, I am new to the PS, so have generally tried to keep costs down with taking metro/busses instead of taxis ect. It is a privilege to travel on government work, and I do not want to abuse it. 


A quick addition, your travel will greatly change depending on who you are going with. For instance, travelling with an ADM, your days are going to be typically long, and planned down to the minute with formal meetings. While travelling with my director it has been more informal meetings and allowed for some flexibility in case things ran long. Make sure you have a business card to hand out!

I travel less than I used to, but still go on a few trips each year.  The government uses HRG as it's travel services provider. It's basically an online platform where you select your flights, you can book your hotel (but you can book directly too), book your train tickets, etc. The same platform is used for your expenses report. The platform isn't super user-friendly, but it ain't too bad. Admin assistants will usually handle the travel requests and expenses reports, but sometimes you have to do it yourself.

As for moving up, there are opportunities, but bear in mind that pretty well *everyone* is looking to get off the phones too, so particularly when you're new, there's a lot of competition. TL is the easiest (still some phone work there, but not as much), but various other positions will promote you as well, such as trainer/instructor (call centres have high turnover, there are almost always training groups that need classroom instruction). There are also various short-term stints/on loan programs where you might get other work short-term. At the place I was at, I think longer-term employees were given one day every two weeks of data entry or the like, to give them a break, and it's in the new union contract that you get 5 minutes off the phone every hour. 

One perk of the call centres and processing centres across the country is that it's fairly easy to transfer to a new city if you so choose (though very difficult to transmute this experience into a federal job in Ottawa, which a lot of people were trying to do when I was there - I think a lot of people *did* eventually do this if they wanted to, but it was on the order of years of trying).

This is covered by the [**Directive on Terms and Conditions of Employment**](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#secA.2). A manager with the appropriate authority (who may be more senior than the manager who is hiring you) needs to explain how one or more of the following circumstances applies:

>there is a shortage of skilled labour in the field involved, as evidenced by local or regional labour market surveys from recognized institutions;

>there are unusual difficulties in filling the position with properly qualified candidates (for example, the minimum rate of pay is not competitive with the rates offered by local or regional employers for similar duties); or

>operational conditions require the presence of a highly skilled or experienced person who can assume the full duties of the position immediately upon taking employment (for example, there is no alternative but to pay above the minimum because training a novice person would impose an unacceptable burden on the employing organization).

If you can make a good case for why one of the above circumstances applies, you could argue that you should start at a higher step level. Chances are good, though, that you won't be able to do this. Experience as a FSWEP/Co-op student is not the same as experience as a regular employee. I'd be grateful that you're starting at step 2 instead of at the bottom - they are already offering you a higher salary than what you're entitled (your salary as a casual has no bearing on your salary when first hired as an employee).

Ensure you have between 3-5 months of sick leave saved up in case something does happen. It will help bridge the gap in case you need to go on long term medical.

Volunteer day and personal day does not role over, so utilise it before you burn your vacation days. (I personally am actually using them for their intended reason)

Loyalty only goes so far, and although a Director or DG might say something, unless it is in writing you have no leg to stand on. This goes for acting assignments, deployments, promotions, or any other major or minor move. 

Ask for clarification if you are not sure on what to do. Nothing is worse than going up the chain to only realise it was not what they wanted. 

Different audiences demand a different voice IE if a deck or BN is ripped apart, do the fixes, and see where they changed wording. This way you know the next time you write a BN to ADM you word it like x

Keep a copy of all your paperwork, security and courses you have taken. 


Always be aware of opportunities, even if you love your job, you might need a change quickly due to management change or life change. Keep your options open, and do not burn bridges. Ottawa is a small town, and if you burn bridges at one department, it may trickle down to your new one.

Pay attention to departmental priorities as they will flow from direction by the Privy Council.  These priorities are conveyed to all managers and are published on the web site. 

Get your manager to provide you with a clear vision of how his or her mandate is to be carried out.  His or her objectives will flow from departmental priorities.  Negotiate your own objectives and make sure you have career development built into your performance agreement.  

As for getting things in writing, that isn't always going to happen.  I had an ADM give me a green light for a project verbally and I went with it.  The project aligned with current priorities.  There was no problem.

If you are asked to do something that seems loose, you can try to get it in writing but you can simply write an e-mail explaining what you have been asked to do, voice your concerns, and then proceed.  That gives you manager a chance to correct your understanding.  If not, he or she cannot deny having known in advance because it's in their inbox.  They will be held accountable if something is wrong.  Make sure your e-mail is retrievable.

If it is dangerous (health and safety), legally you refuse.  If it is illegal, you refuse but understand that might not be an easy option.  It's the right one.  Even a bad manager has a lot of power and cause problems.  Senior management in the Public Serivce is not good at dealing with bad managers until a lot of damage has been inflicted.  In fact, it's just as bad in the private sector.  Bad managers only get dealt with in the private sector if it costs the company money.  In gov't profit isn't a consideration so unless senior managers are paying attention to performance indicators like staff turnover, increased use of sick leave etc., if can go unaddressed for years.

Whatever you do, do it well or don't do it at all.  If your manager finds your work only partially done or incorrectly done nothing else will matter.  You become a liability rather than an asset.  Know your subject matter really well but also know related subject matters as well.  

Try to be multi-disciplinary.  Volunteer for projects that seem to be going somewhere.  The ""stripping files project"" would be something to avoid.  If all you do is fit square pegs into square holes, that's all you will ever be called to do.  When the fitting square pegs job gets surplussed or privatized, there's nothing to go to.

I think that the angst you're feeling is due to multiple factors: economic crisis, shift in paradigm within public service on a global level, and political uncertainty - something we haven't had to worry about too much in Canada. Add to that greater scrutiny and accountability of bureaucratic work and spending which creates a lot of tension amongst the population. This might be why you are receiving so much advice with respect to your career. I did as well...

The more senior servants likely have good intentions when providing this advice, however sometimes it can really demotivate you if it's a constant theme.

Yup. I wasn't asked for proof, but my supervisor has known my spouse for a while. If someone asks, two pieces of mail in each of your names to the same address is usually plenty.

>Question 2: How much advance notice does she have to give her home department prior to going on the leave without pay?

You don't have to, but I gave my supervisor plenty of heads up as soon as we knew a move was a possibility, told him when the move was unofficially announced, and staffed the paperwork immediately after we had paperwork. I wrote a simple memo to my section head, referencing the policies in the collective agreement and the departmental leave manual, and attached a copy of her job offer. We had enough lead time for my boss to begin scouting out new candidates for a transfer to our team, and for me to give an overview of the job to all interested candidates. Helping in the transition made for a smooth departure and avoided any burned bridges.

>Question 3: Can anyone speak to their experience with the spousal relocation priority list and if they received an offer based off it.

I haven't been referred to anything yet, mostly because there are very few positions in my classification in the area. The suggestion I got was to grab some org charts, see what activities my department had out there, and start sending emails to any section heads and team leads where I might fit. Everyone I reached out to was supportive, and one indicated his team might expand in the future and said he'd keep me in mind. So start the legwork now; you might get lucky and find a spot. Plus, I've been told that showing up with a priority hire makes you an attractive candidate since there are fewer staffing hurdles.

Other tips:

If you don't have a job lined up for the new location, apply for EI benefits as soon as you're settled. Relocation of spouse is just cause for leaving your job. It isn't a princely sum, but it sure helps tide you over.

Print out your last few pay stubs before you leave. It took the pay centre several months to generate an ROE. It may be better now, but if you don't have an ROE, Service Canada can make one up for you based on your pay stubs. Also print out any records of courses or training, and anything else you want to have easily accessible when applying for jobs.

Speaking of the pay centre, take any pay you receive after you leave and park it in a high-interest savings account. A few online banks routinely offer bonus interest on new deposits, so take advantage and make a few extra bucks. Don't be tempted to invest it; Murphy's Law says they'll come looking for it just as the fund bottoms out.

Once the pay centre does process your file, you'll be sent a package detailing your options for opting into or out of health and dental insurance. Pension is handled separately, so you can call the pension service centre for an estimate of the buyback, if you wish.

If you've ever been curious about working in the private sector, now's your chance!

You are in the best position right now. Most people who graduate secondary education who do not pursue post-secondary education or training are often in more financially precarious situations. You have the time and security to figure out what you want and act upon it. Take advantage of it.

If you want money, go be an elevator technician. Or not, I mean, you should obviously do more research for a life-changing decision than listening to me. :P But if your real interest is money, do the research and do it seriously. Most suggestions (actuary, investment banker, silicon valley software developer etc.) are always easier said than done. And be realistic about your chances. For competitive industries, if you do not have the attitude and aptitude, you can be out-hustled by those who really want it.

You talk about missed earnings and it's true that you will be missing out on some earnings but many post-secondary options you pursue may have co-op or internship opportunities. These will pay something and for tech, may even pay more than your current salary depending on where you work. In fact, I would be wary of any post-secondary that does not have a component that ensures you graduate with experience.

The last question is about where you want to be geographically. You are in the Atlantic region. Do you want to stay there? Are you willing to move? Part of your research should include where you could work with whatever post-secondary education to pursue.

Since I am in the CS group, I am not super-familiar with other classifications but I heard that you can go pretty far without any post-secondary education in the Public Service. That should be another thing you should research. But once again, it's about attitude and aptitude.

The first thing you have to remember when working for the government is that you won't be rich; you will be comfortable.

The second thing I would recommend doing is look around you and see what is your possible career progression where you work. Talk to your management:

1. Can you qualify with your current experience and knowledge in higher positions within your team should they open up?

2. Can your experience and education make you eligible to apply on other positions within the government and allow better upward movement?

If the answer is no on the first one, than even if 2 is a yes, it's a risky yes, as you are dependant on the position having the clause ""education or experience at managers discretion"".

Can you maybe work out an agreement with your current management to go part-time to school and work less than an FTE without compromising your position? Yes, you will get in debt doing that, but you will have a job guarantee in case you don't like what you are doing.

But let's look at the financial aspect of it, specifically engineering:

* Average salary of a [mechanical engineer](https://www.payscale.com/research/CA/Job=Mechanical_Engineer/Salary): 66K

* Average salary of a [civil engineer](https://www.payscale.com/research/CA/Job=Civil_Engineer/Salary): 64K

* Average salary of a [electrical enginee](https://www.payscale.com/research/CA/Job=Electrical_Engineer/Salary)r: 68K

Now, guessing that in your case, based on your salary, I would say an educated guess of your position is either CR05 (between 52k-56k pay range). Even if next negotiations happen, you will top at 57-59K.

Eventually, the gross cost of life index will catch up to you and will outpace you.

As you said, you are just 24 years old with no dependent... but what happens when your personal life changes and you decide to settle down, buy a house, and possibly start a family?

My advise is this:
Don't look at the financial aspect of it. While it is important and will have an impact on your future, decide what you want to do in life. Engineering, IT, policy, etc... who knows. 

Like you said you are young and you are in a good position to decide what you want to do without sacrificing your current employment.

In a few weeks you'll get the credit for November to increase your sick leave bank to 271.875 hours (assuming that you don't use any sick days in the near future). Sick leave keeps growing each month unless you use it up. 

It's a good idea to aim for a minimum of 13 weeks of banked sick leave (around 500 hours) as insurance if you suffer a major disability. The long-term disability plan doesn't provide benefits until you have used up all your paid sick leave, or after 13 weeks, whichever is longer.

You can verify your pay rate by taking you biweekly *gross* salary, multiplying by 26.088 to get the yearly salary, and comparing against your collective agreement.

> I have always been paid a (more or less) correct amount on time (crossing fingers). Nevertheless, can anyone explain the fluctuations?

Not from the bottom line, since the net salary paid is given by gross salary less deductions.  These can vary:

* Gross salary changes with pay increments and with yearly economic increases (while the collective agreement is not expired)
* Taxes change over the year because deductions for CPP and EI cap out.  These are assessed only on income up to the yearly maximum pensionable earnings level, which is (this year) the first $55.9k of *gross* salary.
* Pension deductions also change at this level.  Salary up to the YMPE level is 'coordinated' with the CPP (that is, gives a lower benefit in retirement) and hence has a smaller contribution rate; salary above this level has a [higher](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/pension-plan/plan-information/public-service-pension-glance.html#toc3) contribution rate.
* *But*, pension contributions are themselves tax-deductible, so contributing at a higher rate reduces the CIT deduction.

In your case, my guess is that as of October 4^(1) you capped out your CPP earnings for the year because of the retroactive pay.  The following pay period you were were no longer paying CPP/EI, but you were still paying the 'low' pension rate because *this* year's salary had not exceeded the YMPE limit.  Subsequently you exceeded this year's YMPE line and began paying at the 'high' rate.

Additionally, your 1 Nov pay did not take deductions for PSHCP (if you signed up for extra hospital coverage), union dues, death benefits, or long-term disability; these are collected on the last two pays in a month for months with three paydates.

Consider that many francophones in the NCR have stories of times they've been the only person really capable of working in French on what is nominally a team with, as you put it, ""a mix of language profiles"": their coworkers might have a B/B/B somewhere on a form, but they casually or overtly push all the French work at the sole francophone, who often also winds up with the expectation that they'll attend all French-language meetings, perform internal translations, verify the work of others, and intercede any time someone gets a unilingual francophone on the telephone. This also means that clients who these francophones support often get left in the lurch or handled inappropriately when the francophone is unavailable or has moved onto a new position: they're stuck dealing with a team who are unwilling or unable to work in French beyond oui/non/pamplemousse.

This reflects a tendency in the public service to work in English, even when the unit is nominally bilingual -- even if most of the employees are francophone. If there's one unilingual anglo hanging around, or an anglo who is nominally B/B/B but sat the test in 1997 and hasn't spoken a word of French since, the language of business will almost always default to English, with French used only for outward-facing functions. That's not really bilingualism.

But, as I said, bilingualism is a wicked problem: part of the reason the public service is so bad at recruiting people with professional designations is because they'll struggle to get above a certain pay grade without bilingualism. In these situations, we need to make a decision about whether we'd rather sacrifice recruitment by prioritising bilingualism, or sacrifice bilingualism by prioritising recruitment. There are arguments for both positions and for what might be situationally optimal, and rarely is one side clearly in the right: sure, dropping bilingualism might make it easier to recruit lawyers and engineers and computer scientists and researchers, but if that leaves you with units which are functionally unilingual or have only one or two employees capable of working in French, you've created other problems.",True,,1511758084.0,1511729284.0,,t3_7fpaw1,t3_7fpaw1,13,0,0

CS05 exists and usually report to a Diretor General. Apart from SSC, CS05 usually report to the CIO of the organization. In my case our CIO is an EX03. For SSC, Directors usually report to senior directors that report to ADM

Is it realistic to be a 5 before 30? No 

Before 40? Maybe

How to prepare to become a CS05? that's not an easy answer.

CS05 are a legacy position - technically they should be EX-01. During the last round of negotiations of our collective agreement, they were left out from certain provisions that benefited the other ranks of CS.

And while you are right that a Director is not a technical position in the sense of getting into the nitty gritty, a CS05 is supposed to have a technical background to be able to understand what his staff is briefing him on.

Is it a high rank? In terms of government, it is considered a junior executive management position since CS05 are equivalent to EX01.

Now back to how you prepare to be a CS05. You learn what you need to know to become a director by going through the ranks of the previous position. As you said it is not a technical position so you need to know how to:

Write management briefs, know how to manage a divisional budget, how to write and prepare decks for senior executive management (ADM and up), write and propose TB subs, manage 20+ employees, review proposals and policies and of course, brief senior management (up to possibly the DM)

Do CS's want to be directors? No not all. Some are happy to stay as a CS02, 03 or 04 due to the fact that they don't want the responsibilities that come with the position.

I've known colleagues who were paid overages as net (after tax and deductions) pay, as one would expect, but then been clawed back as gross (pretax and deductions) amounts. In cases I know about this has also happened with emergency advances, which makes accessing even the supposed ""emergency measures"" specifically for vulnerable folks in a real financial hole, a potential poison pill.

Yes, this can be really scary, and leave one much worse off than where one started. And, as mentioned PSPC, just dgaf. These wild clawbacks have to stop.

Most of the benefit plans, including pension, depend on continuity of employment.  Students and casuals can become pension plan contributors if their terms go over 6 months.

I will let my Manager know that the new Hiring Manager has an ""intent"" to hire me. Although this is only a verbal offer, nothing is set in stone. However, this lets the Manager be aware that there is a procedure going on for them (new Hiring Manager) to hopefully release a LOO. 

This is done 1 month prior to a Start Date. Reasons I take this approach:

1) The current Manager should appreciate your transparency about it. They should also understand your career development and not hold it against you to further progress in the Public Service.

2) Since you're not quitting your job, you'll still retain your current position until you sign another Letter. As long as you don't submit a resignation letter, you have nothing to lose.

3) The current Manager may be upset about all of this, but as in point 1) you're giving them ample time to potentially do a hand-over. The only issue for them is they cannot look for another candidate to back-fill your position until you leave.

The reason one-week notice is fairly brief, is it doesn't help option 1) or 3) for your Manager. You're basically leaving them with having them to scramble with any work you have to make sure nothing is missed when it's transferred to another employee. It can burn bridges.

I know standard is the two-week notice, which is also fair, so this would be most reasonable. However, most teams I've worked on I've given them ample time of my decision so there's no blindside moves that I'm doing and they understand mine, and the Hiring Manager's intent.

I know reddit is very favourable on ""have a LOO signed before you provide any notice"", and I agree with that statement, but reading many comments on this sub I believe many people approach this poorly. They do the following: a lot of people do this maliciously (trying to leverage a LOO with their current team - which won't work easily); or get so caught up with a new promotion they blatantly tell their current Manager they are leaving (which may look unprofessional).

I used to work at Environment Canada when it was implemented...and I was fresh out of school with an FSWEP contract. Forget getting a permanent job with that. Someone explained to me then how budgets work in the government and the best way to get a job during the conservative ""efficiency"" periods (apparently its a cycle) is to either be permanent in a critical position when it happens (aka, work on something voters know/care about like pension, child benefits etc.) or be a consultant.

So I became a consultant.

As a consultant, I saw the frustration as people could easily hire me and yet they had to ask employees who've been working there for a decade at least to ""justify their position"". I would come in to work and my boss had to hire me to help with the workload but nobody wanted to give me anything to do because they want to justify their position. It was really toxic. Add on top of that the usual ""consultants second class people"" feeling and it was a nightmare. It got me enough experience to get a couple nice gigs after though, but I would have preferred to be an employee than a consultant.

I recently worked with people who were in the ""critical position"" situation and YET they were told they were on the chopping block and had to be transferred. When that happened, people who could go on an early retirement were encouraged to do so and they would just not refill your position...officially.

In reality, they would ask someone else to do the job you used to do and either give you an acting for it or not...and ask you to do the job of a CS-03 as a CS-02 and be happy you didn't lose your job.

So the employer had an obligation to help you find another position elsewhere in the PS if you were on the chopping block and if you couldn't, you would lose your job, get a severance package and I think if somehow they got a job for you after, up to a year after your departure, they could call you and bring you in easily.

Also they were unofficial, off the book, cuts that happened. In the last year of ""The Previous Government"", they had their regular budget with the instruction to not spend it all. I'll let you make your own opinion about that.

So to answer your questions finally:

 1. **It will happen again.** My parents told me it happened before so assume it will again. We just don't know when. It's a cycle of ""we need to invest in our public service to help the middle class"" followed by ""we need to fix inefficiencies and save money"". There's a strong sentiment against the public service and how inefficient the whole system is so a general rule of thumb is: if a party is promising to fix the public service ""inefficiency"" and ""reduce waste""...pay attention. The lack of details is usually a sign of trouble and if the details involve ""merging"" stuff, vote vote vote.

 2. Phoenix is a indirect consequence of it. They wanted to save money by improving the efficiency, and in the eyes of many, an efficient system is one with fewer employees. So we are very much still seeing the consequences of that. Introduce deep cuts pushing senior employees out the door and preventing new employees in followed by a pay system that's very unstable and you have a employer that's incredible unattractive to what the public service needs the most: new blood. 

 3. The way the cuts were done were by assessing priorities based on upper management's agenda. Things were deemed essential or superfluous and anything in between. Based on the budget they had an idea of how many employees they had to let go and they would start picking in the low priority and people about to retire. Like I said,I heard stories of people having to document what they do and justify their role to their boss who's supposed to know that stuff anyway.

Then we were told we had to identify the most essential positions (this was for me, not a general statement for the entire public service) as we had something like 20 or 25% budget cut. No one lost its job where I worked because we were lucky enough to have a shortage of people (PG community) and had empty seats, and the worst part is, I had two employees who wished they were cut and offered a package to retire, but we couldn't do it. The shortage of employees was much worse during and after the freeze, we are slowly recovering but it has affected our operations negatively (basically there is a large gap of specialists, so now the new employees move up really quickly but don't have the skills and experience they would have needed 10 years ago).

In some teams, if they were 10 employees at the same level and they had to cut 1 position, all 10 were identified that their job was at risk and were told they would have to compete for their job... and then nothing for months and months, so people got stressed out, a few managed to find work elsewhere and in the end if 3 people left and couldn't be replaced, no one lost its job.

Also if you make $20K more you will likely lose 40-45% in income taxes because the tax rate is not adjusted to the cost of living, so people in large cities are penalized.

On the other side, if you retire with a higher pension and move back to NB to spend it, you will be wealthier. Same thing for the equity on an expensive house after 20 years for example.

I was in your situation a few years back (Poli sci + philosophy) and unilingual without relevant experience outside of school. Set up automatic emails for unilingual positions in locations of your choice on jobs.gc.ca. Apply for desired jobs every day that they pop up. Try to do them earlier than later. Sometimes competitions say they expire after a few months, but that's typically so they can ""pull"" results multiple times if they need to. If you miss the first pull, you might miss the whole thing. Apply for positions you qualify for, not just ones you're interested in or that may be related to your education. For me this meant CR and AS positions in addition to EC and FS. Unilingual hits hard in the NCR. It might be difficult or impossible to get what you want. What is important is getting in and getting some in-house experience while networking within your department to discover internal opportunities. That's something you won't have access to from the outside. 

For me, I ended up going back to school for a master's degree to get more experience and work towards an in-demand knowledge.

Ontario Liberal Senator Jim Munson \(Ottawa\-Rideau Canal\), a deputy chair of the powerful Senate Internal Economy, Budgets, and Administration Committee, broke the news Wednesday at a media availability in the Senate foyer. The committee makes decisions about the Chamber's financial and legal affairs. He said that about 200 of the 700 Senate employees have been affected per year by overpayments or underpayments since the Senate moved to the Phoenix pay system in April 2016.

""We want to make sure that our employees are valued. And when you show up to work, you expect a paycheque. So in the Senate of Canada it's not different. And the reason we could do it is because we're an autonomous institution,"" he said. ""We recognize there was a major problem and we're confident that this will alleviate some of the financial stresses and strains.

""The contract was signed April 26 with ADP Canada, and is worth $902,250 over five years, said Senate spokesperson Alison Korn in an emailed statement. The first\-year cost is $171,650, with an annual increase of 2.5 per cent \(so the fifth\-year cost is $189,470\), as well as a one\-time implementation cost of $25,000.ADP Canada, a human resources firm based in Toronto, was chosen because it has the expertise to do the work in a timely manner, has a proven track record of customer satisfaction, successful on\-time and on\-budget implementation, responsive and effective technical support, and is financially sound, said Ms. Korn.

ADP pays one in four Canadians in the private sector, according to information on its website.Being a bilingual company, it seemed to fit the unique needs of the Senate, said Sen. Munson. He said the Senate hopes to have the new system in place by the fall, but Ms. Korn said it's too early to give an exact date.

As for next steps, Ms. Korn said, ""the Senate and ADP Canada are developing a timeline and action plan for importing payroll data as well as for the design, testing, and implementation of the new payroll system.

""The Phoenix pay system went live in two waves in February and April 2016, and since then has left about 75 per cent of federal government workers underpaid, overpaid, or not paid at all. The project had two parts: to use off\-the\-shelf software configured to the government's human resources systems, dubbed Phoenix, to pay employees; and to centralize the compensation advisers for 46 government departments and agencies at the Public Service Pay Centre in Miramichi, N.B.

The 55 other departments and entities\-including the Senate and the House of Commons\-have their own in\-house compensation advisers. Senators are not paid by the Phoenix system, so only staff experienced problems.

Examples of issues experienced include that Phoenix does not consistently pay vacation pay accurately; it does not calculate some retroactive payments correctly; and it pays overtime rates for casual workers who work additional hours at a single rate, therefore needing manual correction for each pay.In June, the Senate started down the road of ditching Phoenix when it issued a request for information from potential service providers before considering a call for proposals, to get more information on the payroll outsourcing services available on the market.

In October, it posted a request for proposals on the government's procurement website seeking a company to ""assume responsibility for payroll processing...for all employees of the Senate of Canada."" The request for proposals closed Nov. 30, and Sen. Munson said there were seven interested bidders.

The bidders were evaluated on a number of criteria, said Ms. Korn, including their payroll solutions and services, their call centre, their employee self\-service portal, their payroll administrator portal, and their security, privacy, and confidentiality.

Sen. Munson said he empathizes with those affected by Phoenix, noting ""it's caused hardship, undue hardship, and it's unfair.""He said the Senate switched because it had the ability to do so, being autonomous from the government. Unfortunately, that's not really possible for government departments, he said, so ""obviously the sooner... the government of Canada fixes this, the better.""

""The government hasn't given a timeline to fix Phoenix, which has cost taxpayers more than $1\-billion, but in the last budget it announced $16\-million for the Treasury Board to start looking for its replacement. ",True,,1525387729.0,1525358929.0,,t3_8gqw9r,t3_8gqw9r,4,0,0

Well I inherited the problem when I took the position and decided to do something about it. I realized that the employee clearly had mental health issues, like serious issues, but I was told by labour relations that we could not force her to consult (and I of course cannot make a diagnostic!). After a while when she noticed I wasn't going to let it go, she managed to get a long-term sick leave and when she came back months later, and I was still there (I was in an acting position that kept getting renewed) the grievances and harassement complains started. It was so bad that even the union took my side... informally after meeting with labour relations they said there wasn't much anyone could do.

In the end, senior management decided to move her away from me as if I was the problem instead of supporting me to finish the job (or force her to get the help she needed).

And of course, things went very well in the new team for a month and the same pattern came back... it took years and another move in the department for that person to finally quit the public service before getting fired, but at least it wasn't my problem anymore.

* You will not move up as quickly as you feel you ought to, or you will feel like your success or failure isn't tied in any meaningful way to your competence and your initiative. Then again, you'll watch certain people catapulted into high positions and you'll wonder what the hell happened.  Much of your success is predicated on having someone powerful that likes you and protects you. Under that protection, you can then show initiative and feel the rewards of success. Without that protection, you will get stomped on by others who feel threatened by your initiative.

* Your opinion is not wanted, even if you have expertise on the file. *Especially* if you have a negative opinion on the work being undertaken.  This is true no matter what level you work at. It is one of the obligations of public servants to speak unpopular truths in the face of political will. It's also one of the most terrifying things, because of the implied threat of loss of career mobility. Many shy away from that duty, preferring saying flattering things or agreeing with the powerful in the hopes of favours. But some come to the table armed with binders full of facts and speak anyway.

- Respecting hierarchy and policies: there is nothing wrong with that rigidity. The problem comes when making a change is too hard. You will see, you will love people that adhere to guidelines and whatnot rigidly - otherwise it means you are stuck with assclowns who either do not understand their job or don't care enough.

- Moving up is as hard and as easy as people make it sound. It is not true that you need a powerful friend to move up - like anywhere else it is not a bad thing though. If you are good, not an asshole to others and APPLY TO GET PROMOTIONS, you will move up (this is key, people think that ""oh it's been five years at a certain level, I am due for a promotion""...NOPE!)

- It is dog eat dog, like any other places where moving up means big bucks. Just don't pay attention to them and remain professional, excel and apply. You will move up while those grudgy people will remain at the same level.

- Do no listen to people complaining about their work or workplace. Most people I know hate their work or workplace, even if they chose the work and love the work...

As to your question about union dues - chances are you're represented by the Union of Taxation Employees (https://www.ute-sei.org/en/about). It's a component of the Public Service Alliance of Canada (www.psacunion.ca). As they noted, you do *not* need to join the union unless you want to do so. You're obligated to pay union dues either way, and the union is obligated to represent you either way. This is known as the ""Rand Formula"". Details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_formula

The exact amount of union dues with PSAC is tricky, because it's calculated as a percentage of salary, with portions going to PSAC, to the component (UTE) and to the local union. Either way, the union should be able to tell you how much those percentages are if you ask.

Most paid leave (vacation, personal leave days, family-related leave, etc, along with unpaid leave like maternity/parental) will be covered by your collective agreement: https://www.ute-sei.org/en/bargaining/current-collective-agreement.

0. File according to your T4(s) and pay tax ""owed"" accordingly.

1. Call the Phoenix line at 1-855-686-4729, choose the tax issue menu option (#2) and request they reissue the correct T4 (as well as the other pay issues). They should issue you a case number (if not ask). If nothing else this is useful for buggin them about it in the months to come.

2. Call CRA at 1-888-556-5083 (7am-9pm est). They will tell you to look at the Canada.ca faq, but also will tell you that you can dispute your filing.

3. Wait for your notice of assessment then file a T400A to dispute the assessment and the tax paid. Provide as much documentation as you can. These could ultimately end up in tax court, so you may want to have an accountant or a tax lawyer look these over if the amounts are significant, whatever that means to you. You may be able to recover these costs eventually, however you do have to pay them yourself upfront.

The priority ""list"" is actually a database of people who have a priority status under either the Public Service Employment Act or the Public Service Employment Regulations. There are a number of reasons that people might have a priority status, but the bottom line is that those people *must* be hired ahead of anybody else to any position where they are both interested and qualified. HR has to query the priority system and notify any potentially-interested persons, and those people have a chance to say whether they're interested or not. If they're interested, then the manager has to assess them to decide if they are qualified. The process of checking the priority list and verifying that no priorities are interested or qualified is known as the ""priority clearance"" process. It can take as little as two days (if there are no priorities who match in the system when the request is made) to several weeks (if multiple priority persons indicate interest and need to be assessed). 

Priority clearance is a mandatory requirement for virtually all term or indeterminate hiring processes. Until the system has been checked, neither HR nor your manager will know how long the clearance process will take. There may also be other approval/paperwork steps involved that could delay the process.

Until you have an offer letter, you should continue searching for other employment. There are many reasons that the offer could fall through, so until it's in writing it's best to treat it as if it'll never happen. ",True,,1524977343.0,1524948543.0,,t3_8flqde,t3_8flqde,1,0,0

0,dy2nhjt,8fdl6i,t5_3f8vd,20,mainland_infiltrator,Department of Regional Incentive Targets (moderator/modérateur),False,t1_dy2nhjt,"A few reasons why managers do this:

**Thing One**: Especially for people coming *to* the NCR, it's not at all uncommon for people to accept a job mostly just to get relocated. They join Department A, and Department A foots the bill for their relocation, and they get all set up and situated, and four months later they deploy to Department B, and that's that: Department A gets stuck paying the full relocation, but Department B gets the employee.

**Thing Two**: Relocations are expensive. Even Directors General will generally be unable to pony up for more than one or two a year before they need to find additional money. Which is to say that they're okay using them to bring in a sure-thing unicorn at a fairly high level, but persuading them to take a chance on an early-career person is a big lift.

**Thing Three**: Leaving a competition open to all Canadians means you get a lot of people who (1) aren't qualified for the job, (2) aren't interested in the job, (3) are applying for every job on the site regardless of points 1 and 2, and (4) would not accept the job if offered. Trawling through all this dross is not a good use of your time, even if there are a few gems in there. (I mean, let's be real: there's no shortage of external candidates qualified to take on, say, an AS-02. Do you really need to consider every single one of them across the country, or can you just pick from the thousands who already live in Ottawa?)

**Thing Four**: Relocations are slow and risky. Adding a relocation will reliably add between 4 and 12 weeks to the staffing process, and that's 4 to 12 weeks of needing to constantly monitor and update and track the situation -- and even then, the employee can change their mind right up until the very last minute.

Maybe she gets a better job elsewhere. Maybe she can't find a school she deems acceptable for her children. Maybe she decides she just doesn't want to live this far away from an aging parent. Maybe her partner puts the kibosh on it. Maybe she gets to Ottawa and discovers that big cities are big and scary and intimidating and that she'd rather stay in Grover's Corners, where the grass is sweet and the people are nice and the trolleys only cost a nickel. Doesn't matter: she's got wide latitude to cancel at any time.

Conversely, if you pick someone who already lives in Ottawa, you won't be in for any surprises on this front. They already live here. They already know where your offices are. They can start as soon as you get a Letter of Offer spun up.

You'll have literally 100x more opportunities to develop in the NCR than you do anywhere else. Apart from formal opportunities (CSPS courses, workshops, seminars, developmental programs, structured networks, etc.) and informal opportunities (personal networks, GCConnex, water-cooler discussions, etc.), the way headquarters jobs are structured is completely different from how regional jobs work and flow, and there's a baked-in expectation that headquarters staff *will* develop and grow and improve (and that this should be actively pursued by managers and taken seriously and have time and budget allocated to it, etc.), whereas ""development"" in the regions tends to be trivial-to-nonexistent.

This is a major blind spot for the public service as a whole, and -- IMO -- actually a considerable weakness within the public service. (Apart from the cultural disjunct, we've got plenty of good people working in the regions who basically have zero developmental opportunities, and plenty of money being wasted on NCR-exclusive initiatives which don't really accomplish a whole lot apart from buffing up people's CVs. It's a bad combination.)

But, yes, if your goal is career progression, you need to get yourself to the NCR, full stop, run don't walk, do it as soon as you can. Your odds of attracting a short-term acting aren't great, but especially if you have policy experience, your chances of making it over on an indeterminate basis are pretty good.

1. Work in the regions, period. (What is the administrator of the RCMP detachment in North Frigid, Saskatchewan supposed to do with an invitation to a Wellness Fair in Gatineau? Tools like these have a way of being completely useless once you're more than about 40 kilometers away from Parliament Hill.)
2. Work in contexts which don't map onto GCConnex and similar tools. (You're a grain inspector in Manitoba. You don't really aspire to be anything but a grain inspector in Manitoba: maybe an increasingly senior one, but still basically a grain inspector in Manitoba. Such a person has basically no use for *any* of GCConnex's features: they don't want to network, they don't want to blog or read blogs, they don't want an opportunities platform, they don't care about micro-missions, they don't care about Workplace 2.0 or OneGovTeam or whatever else... none of it helps them in any way.)

GCconnex is 10 years old. It started, in part, because FB was simply not allowed on GC networks back then and we wanted to provide employees with a place to connect. Is it still a necessary forum/tool? I like to think so even if the raison d'être isn't the same. Has the GCtools engagement team performed better than described? I do think so too also.

On the OG's recommendations:  it looks to me as no.1 will be happening naturally (shifting priorities, $ availability, TBS desire to ""show the thing/build the thing""). On no.2, it's tougher...

I'm all for frank discussions and typically jump right in them (like in this one). I'm using the same handle over multiple platforms and have no issues with people linking back my opinions to my identify (not a critique or anything about people who prefer anonymity, that's just how I approach things). All of this being said, a lot of people just take things too damn seriously and are afraid to make bold/frank statements, thinking it might affect their ""personal brand"" or might limit their career progression. Even if GCtools went forward and pushed for a ""be uncomfortably frank"" stance on GCconnex, some users will only stay on the safe side of the line, and/or user the tool to self-promote. GCconnex is both a tool and a community. The tool isn't perfect, but on it's own, it can't make the community ""better""...

On the reply about GCconnex being a tool for HQ employees by HQ employees, I tempted to say that I agree (at least in part). We need to build more use cases that will make GCtools useful to more people.

I also got a letter from OSAP (student loans and grants) that I was banned for the next 5 years as I under claimed my earnings for the year ( I put what I was supposed to be getting paid). When I was a student the overpayments didn’t raise any red flags as I didn’t have access to my pay stubs for government.  I was also working a second job as a bartender, so that confused things further. Point is they are slow to let you know and will be looking to get it back quickly unless if you tell them otherwise.

This is slightly different from *dual employment* which occurs when an employee accepts a term position while on LWOP from an indeterminate position. With dual employment, you only actively get paid in one position (the term position) 

As to pay and administration, it’s much less common to be hired into a dual remuneration situation than to do a transfer between departments and it can make administering things like paid leave more complex. With dual remuneration each position is treated as an independent job, so you can’t (for example) use banked sick leave from your first job to take time off from your second job - for the second job you would start as if you were an external hire with no banked leave credits.

If you take the second job and then later resign from the first job, I’m not sure if you can at that point transfer over things like banked vacation and sick leave.

**Appendix “F”**

**Memorandum of Understanding Between the Treasury Board of Canada and the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada With Respect to Occupational Group Structure Review and Classification Reform**

This memorandum is to give effect to the agreement reached between the Employer and the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada (PIPSC) in respect of employees in the Computer Systems (CS) bargaining unit. The Employer is committed to engaging in meaningful consultation with the PIPSC with respect to the review of the CS occupational group, followed by meaningful consultation regarding Classification Reform.
Meaningful consultation on Classification Reform will include consultation on the development of a standard which reflects and measures, in a gender neutral manner, elements including skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions of work performed by CS employees.

The review of the CS group falls within the broader context of the Occupational Group Structure (OGS) Review. Consultation and work on the CS occupational group review, including developing an implementation strategy, will be completed by December 2019.
The agreement cannot be interpreted as a relinquishment of management rights over classification or as a guarantee that a consensus can be reached on any of the outcomes of the consultation themselves.

To answer your immediate questions, you can take LWOP while on probation. The remainder of your probation period is re-instated when you re-join. However, depending where you go, you may stay on the priority list for a long time. I'm currently going through the process now as my spouse has relocated. I decided to stay back and work at my current job while I aggressively try to find a deployment, as my classification is scarce in our new region (I found one though!). I gave myself a deadline for 6 months to find a job before I go on LWOP and get on the priority list. Also note, you can get EI for relocating with no job offer imminent.

**Leave with Income Averaging**: plan to take a big chunk of time off, and reduce your pay accordingly -- but you continue to be paid during your leave.

Suppose you make a nice, tidy $100,000 per year. You decide you want to take the whole months of June, July and August off in order to go on a cycling holiday in Europe, or write your novel, or fix up an old house you've inherited, whatever. Those three months make up about 25% of your annual hours, so we'd reduce your annual pay to $75,000 -- but we'd continue to pay you year-round, *even during your three months of leave*.

**Compressed Workweek**: work extra hours without taking overtime, then convert those extra hours into time off. A common formulation is to work an extra 50 minutes a day for two weeks, but take the second Friday off with pay, effectively turning every other weekend into a long weekend. (50 minutes * 9 workdays = 450 minutes = 7.5 hours = 1 full day of work.)

**Flex Time**: your manager expects you to work 37.5 hours a week, to be available for meetings Monday to Friday between 10 AM and 3 PM, to attend occasional meetings outside of that window, and to get your work done. Beyond that, your time is yours:

* Arrive at 7 AM and leave at 3 PM. (Great for parents of young school-aged kids!)
* Arrive at 10 AM and leave at 6 PM. (Great for those who aren't morning people and like getting a seat on the bus!)
* Take a 3-hour lunch, then make up the facetime by staying late.

0,dxkrjih,8d6hvr,t5_3f8vd,10,AmhranDeas,,False,t1_dxkrjih,"So, a few things that leap out at me:

* Not completing mandatory training - most of the time, that's a couple of hours or so doing an online course. If you had time to send emails out to other managers looking for a job, surely you had time to do the mandatory training.  Not doing this would make me think you're not taking the job seriously, and it would make me question what else isn't getting done while you do personal things on the government's time.

* Unauthorized days off - this is different from the flexible work arrangement you describe above. Did you take days off that you only asked for after the fact? Or worse, did you call in sick, but then go out in public and do something where someone might have seen you (like, for example, shopping, or going to a restaurant or a bar)? If something like this happened, that's a big, big problem. Not just because you took the unauthorized day off (which means the supervisor can't trust you to respect the rules), but because now your supervisor can't trust that you're telling the truth.

* Unsolicited supervisor and director references - Do you have proof of that your management reached out on their own to speak to managers considering hiring you? It's more likely that a manager to whom you made overtures reached out to your current boss to find out about you. This happens all the time, and is perfectly normal. And they have the right to give whatever reference they see fit.  But if they gave you as bad a reference as you say, then you pissed off two levels of management above you enough to warn others away from hiring you. *You need to step back and ask yourself what you did that made them warn others about you*.

* You say you had a flexible work arrangement with your supervisor, but how did this work in practice? Did you email the night before and say ""hey, could I switch this day for that day? Please let me know"" and then abide by the supervisor's decision if they said ""no, I need you to come in""? Or was it more like ""hey, I'll be in on this day instead of that day"", regardless  of what your supervisor wanted? Switching days like that is *always* at the supervisor's discretion, and they are dealing with a file they need your help on, you should be going in.

All of the above adds up to a massive headache on the part of the supervisor. It isn't about the nuts and bolts of how you handled some specific project or document, this is about the soft skills that are crucial to the working world. Your supervisor was trying to do you a solid by being flexible with work arrangements, which tells me they were trying to make you feel welcome and engaged in the workplace. They could just have easily been a hard-ass and insisted on a specific schedule, and tapped their watch at you if you were late by five minutes. 

By all means, have that sit-down with your supervisor, but honestly, speaking as a supervisor myself, your post is full of red flags.

But there *is* hope. You're young, just barely starting out. Be humble, learn from this. Learn what behaviours are expected in the workplace, and do those to the best of your ability. Next job you get, figure out who the golden boy or golden girl is (the one management thinks walks on water) and behave the way they do, and work the way they work.

0,dxjvyo1,8d245l,t5_3f8vd,9,robotneedsbeer,,False,t1_dxjvyo1,"From most pressing to least, here's my top four. I could do a lot more, but these are the issues that have been the most serious in the last four or five processes we've done. We've done full public with pool, govt only, branch, only. We've used student bridges (a lot, this is by far and away the absolute best way to hire entry-level staff, imo) and most recently a couple of non-advertised appointments (not super comfortable with those as a long-term solution for anything, but sometimes they're needed as a band-aid).

1. A consistent HR ""client manager"". One of the worst problems we've had is advisor churn. This was the leading cause for delay in my last competitive process. Every time a new HR advisor came on stream, we experienced a two-to-three week delay. We had, no word of a lie, more than ten advisors on the file. It took 18 months to complete, from PAR to hire. This created mass confusion among applicants (they didn't know who to contact) and even, we believe lead to some candidate being unable to communicate with us for significant lengths of time (up to a month in one case). This was a cause of significant distress for both candidates and managers.

2. Turn-around-times that have meaning with HR. Even with changing advisors, things like PAR processing, classification (especially using generics), and processing paperwork (e.g. preparing the LoO for signature) should have deterministic timelines that are respected within the HR structure. Preferably, no step should take more than two weeks (from client, back to client). Again, great uncertainty when a manager has to respond back to a client: ""That's with HR, we can't tell you when it might be done"". We waited 4 months for a LoO (to be prepared for signature) on a recent hire. All the candidates were getting very agitated by the end of month 1. You can imagine how people felt with by month 4. Uncertainty in time lines is a huge part of the problem.

3. Meaningful support for managers preparing materials. Managers frequently have to write these from scratch. I'm convinced that this is a major issue with squirrelly and awkward SOMC and the interview and exam question that get written as a result. Managers don't have experience or training with many tools like behavioural interviews. So why are managers the ones who have to write and administer these materials? Why doesn't HR have a) previous SOMCs, exams and interview texts on file as models for managers to work with? b) common formats for things that shouldn't need to be re-written like reference checks and scoring rubrics? Generic job descriptions have been a great help, and have significantly improved classification ""hell"". We need more of that template approach at every step of the process. Candidates benefit from having an even and fair approach to evaluation materials, rather than ones entirely idiosyncratic for each competition.

4. This is the one that you probably won't be able to do: eliminate the idea that a criterion can only be evaluated at one step, then must be ignored at subsequent steps. Why can't interviewers ask about education and experience? Why can't there be a personal suitability question on both the written exam and at the oral stage? Candidates respond differently with different communication strategies. I've always felt it unfair to candidates that, for example, we only evaluate experience by CV, for example. It feels very counter-intuitive, and so confusing, to candidates too. I understand the logic at play here, but I disagree with the ""hurdle"" model it forces candidates and managers to navigate. I think it dehumanizes the process and significantly contributes to the feeling that government evaluations are overly structured and not responsive to manager or candidate needs.

This is a topic I've thought a lot about, as I've had to do a lot of hiring in a lot of different ways in the past 5-6 years. It's a place the service needs some drastic improvement. The NDonS is a welcome initiative, but it's hardly the entire solution, the structural and cultural change we need to fix the current crisis within HR.",True,,1524054650.0,1524025850.0,,t3_8d245l,t3_8d245l,9,0,0

In all seriousness though, and I may catch some down votes for this, but there needs to be a better system to centralize hiring functions (PSC?). The GoC also needs to shift its mindset from *the employee belongs to Unit X, in Department Y*, to *the employee belongs to, and is free to move around the GoC.* Think global, act local.

- Each department maintains a core group of strategic HR advisors/Business Partners, and of course compensation advisors, because...Phoenix.
- Centralized body maintains a repository of up-to-date assessments and recent resumes of all GoC employees, consultants, students, etc.
- Centralized body assesses interested parties for writing, analytical, numeric, etc. skills. The basics. Results are good for 3-5 years? (Think DRAP..PIMS..Priority System for all interested GoC employees - which hopefully is working a lot better now)
- Departmental managers access the repository and conduct short and sweet interviews to hire, deploy, etc. The main evaluations have already been conducted by the centralized body. Now you're just picking the best fit.

I'm sure this system has already been attempted in some form or another, so I don't think Í'm offering any groundbreaking ideas. However, it may actually work now, because individuals and departments are starting (emphasis on starting) to realize the importance and benefits of hiring good, qualified candidates.

Are you a term employee or indeterminate? If you’re a term, what’s the length of the term?

If you’re hired as a term employee for *less* than 6 months (January to July, for example), then you aren’t eligible for benefits until you’ve been working for six months or until your employment is extended beyond six months total duration. If you’re hired as a term *over* 6 months or indeterminate, you’re eligible for health benefits as soon as you are hired.

The benefit plans won’t show up in your collective agreement. The health and dental plans are negotiated by the “National Joint Council” and are the same for all employees regardless of which union you’re part of or which collective agreement you fall under. You’ll find information on the health and dental plans (and the disability insurance plan) on the NJC website: https://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca

For the health care plan, you should only need to be contributing to the plan if you selected level II or III coverage - at level I (the default) the employee contribution is zero (see schedule V of the PSHCP Directive). The only difference between the different coverage levels is the amount that the plan will pay for room and board charges for a stay in a hospital - if you request a private room, for example. At level I it’s capped at $60/day, at level II it’s capped at $140/day, and at level III it’s capped at $220 a day.  Personally, I’ve never seen any reason to choose anything other than level I coverage but it’s up to each person to decide. 

If you have a certificate number assigned to you, then your coverage under the plan is active. You should be able to register on the Sun Life website for the positive enrolment. 

The health plan is administered by Sun Life, and the dental plan is administered by Great West Life. They are two separate plans, with separate certificate/plan numbers. The dental plan has a three-month waiting period.

As a casual end-user in programs work, it's not the best and it's not the worst. It's still not capable of providing the level of detail I need, even at the divisional level, let alone at the unit section or project levels. It's not timely; it can be a month or more behind where we actually are. It does not offer enough flexibility as a forecasting tool. Money has to be committed or not. There seems to be no way to do soft forecasting. There are business process issues in there too, but many issues are structural within the function of SAP.

The interfaces and reporting deserve special mention. It's very 1990s database. Its user interface is astonishing to kids raised with Apple or modern web apps. This is one area where there would seem to be a lot of easy wins which have all been missed.

In short, we wrestle with it, as we wrestled with its predecessors. It does about 2/3rds of what it should do. It's manageable, but since coming in a few years ago, hasn't overall, improved efficiency. We still need to keep  our own ""black books"" to properly manage our finances.

We commonly use another piece software for generating, managing and tracking regulatory and legal datasets. Complexity is similar. SAP often comes out poorly in comparison in both workflow and capability. The interface isn't even comparable in terms of usability (and this has deep effects on workflow). Reporting is extremely primitive in comparison.

Enterprise Resource Planning systems are the future in my opinion.

Nah. At least, not with SAP.

SAP, in government, is:

1. Thousands and thousands of workarounds. Every day a new workaround. (And I don't mean people sitting at their desks trying to illicitly shove numbers into the system, although people do attempt to do so. I mean you call the helpdesk and ask a very basic question and the response is an hourlong journey through six transactions you've never even seen before, none of which relate to what you're trying to accomplish, in order to smoke-and-mirrors the system into doing what you need it to do.)
2. Poorly-documented and incomprehensible to the vast majority of end-users. End-users are generally only trained in the actual usage of those few transactions deemed necessary to them, and it's taught in the same manner that you might be taught to assemble an Ikea table: put Value A into Slot 4. Put Value B into Slot 3. Execute. Many end-users have no clue how to operate the system without a binder of printouts guiding them through every single step, and those same end-users get into an uproar any time anything changes.
3. Connected to other systems with bubble gum and duct tape. The seams between SAP and parallel systems (like acquisition cards, travel approvals, cartography, inventory control, etc.) are highly visible and frequently break down.
4. Completely disjointed from department to department. Being trained as an SAP end-user at one department does not equip you to use the tool at another, not even to perform the exact same functions using the exact same transactions. (This is largely the result of the thousands and thousands of workarounds to which I alluded earlier.)
5. Failing, in many cases, to make government paperless. At a previous department of mine, switching onto SAP easily tripled the amount of paper over what we got out of the departmental legacy system.
6. A process by which the actual business needs of the organisation are snatched away from the operations people who actually implement these processes, and instead handed over to a group of consultants who tend to redesign the function to suit SAP. (At the rollout to which I alluded to earlier, the on-site subject-matter experts were continually stonewalled by the visiting consultants: SAP can't do that, the new process doesn't allow that, we'll need to take that up with Public Works and see whether it's in-scope, SAP can't do that, we have a new process for that and it involves 12 steps instead of 2, SAP can't do that... and these questions were about basic functions which were built into legacy systems and were pretty fundamental to on-the-ground operations in this instance.)

My take-away is that they don't actually *want* SAP power users except at the very highest levels. The means by which they train and equip end-users to work with SAP suggests that they want us to know as little as necessary and to think only in terms of the functions we're taught by rote, rather than having us gain broader knowledge and begin to consider how we might do things better or more efficiently -- and while you're at it, internalize this ever-changing list of counterintuitive workarounds, or else the whole system breaks down.

the security screening was previously done in accordance with the Standard on Security Screening
there is no adverse information on file

You already have disability insurance at work. You also have life insurance, in the form of the Supplementary Death Benefit (which pays 2x your salary). There's also survivor benefits tied to the pension plan. 

There's an argument to be made for having some life insurance that's separate from the SDB and pension plan, but personally I think ""mortgage insurance"" is a colossal rip-off. For the cost of that insurance you could just get a small term life policy, and have coverage beyond your mortgage balance.

The campus is somewhat removed from any commercial district, so there's no private parking available within walking distance.

Fortunately, the initial buildings were constructed in the 50s when parking lots were still permitted in the budget envelope.  Unfortunately, there have been a number of buildings added to the campus since then and not enough corresponding parking spots for the increase in employees (numbered in the hundreds).  They've done what they can to maximize parking availability, including designated carpool spots close to the buildings to encourage ride-sharing. They've been working with the municipality for years to improve transit service and are finally on the way to getting full-day service (still a couple years away, afaik).

DEVELOPMENT IN THE PHENIX CLASS ACTIONS


The Quebec Superior court allows the classe action against the Canadian Government regarding the moral damages in the Phoenix pay system matter.


Class Action Authorized


On April 3rd, 2018, the Superior Court authorized our class action on behalf of employees and ex-employees of the Government of Canada. The Action claims damages related to the Phoenix Pay System. 

 
Who is included in the class? 


The Class covers all of Canada. 
 

The status of included members was limited by the Court. Employees who have a right to file a grievance under section 208 of the Federal Public Sector Labor Relations Act were excluded from the Class. This affects both unionized and non-unionized employees. 
 

The resulting Class is composed of all employees and ex-employees who cannot file a grievance, among which Students, Occasional employees and Retirees. 
 

Our team is concerned about the excluded members’ access to justice, especially for non-unionized employees such as managers. Without access to a form of collective representation or to independent arbitration of their claims, these persons will form a sizeable but largely silent subgroup. We are currently reviewing the possibility of filing an appeal on this issue. 
 

In any case, it is imperative for employees and ex-employees to file a grievance without delay, or to try to do so. If your grievance is refused by your union or the Government, ask for a proof of refusal and provide it to us.
 

Actions to take


Members included in the Class definition do not have any action to take. They will automatically form part of the Class. Over the following weeks, notices will be approved by the Court and published. 
 

People excluded from the current Class definition or who have the right to grieve should file a grievance to preserve their rights.

The original version of the Court judgment is in French. We will send a translation as soon as it becomes available.

I have seen some people have to take leave without pay due to emergencies happening and them not having enough leave banked. 

Although I am also cognizant that for people who have children, especially small ones, more illness is a reality. Small kids are very good disease vectors, so there will be more time off. Same with older people who are more prone to have chronic health conditions that require more time off. 

With that said, back when the government was freaking out over the number of sick days, it occurred to me that if there was an option to cash out your sick leave when you retire, even at a great discount (say 25% of its value), it may actually be enough to reduce the number of sick days taken when someone is not actually sick.

Sick leave is different, though. It's a form of insurance to protect your income if you're sick and unable to work. If you use it all up, then you've ""cashed in"" the insurance policy and no longer have any insurance - that's the incentive to not use it unnecessarily.

She told me of many conversations she'd had with employees who called her asking for information about ""short-term disability"". She'd be the one to have to break the news to them that there was no such plan, and that if they had used up all their paid sick leave their only option was to take sick leave *without pay* and that they wouldn't be eligible for long-term disability until 13 weeks after being off work.",True,,1523652315.0,1523623515.0,,t3_8bwoul,t3_8bwoul,6,0,0

They might have a chronic pain condition or suffer from migraines. Back pain can be excruciating and for all you know, that person’s doctor or physiotherapist advised them to take a week off work. 

The anxiety you feel at taking more than a week off at a time - which is a totally normal and reasonable thing to do! - is something that you should probably work on yourself. I am not saying this in a snide or mean way. I have an anxiety disorder that I see a therapist for. It can be really challenging to take a step back and realize that “wait a minute, this situation is not something I should be feeling this level of anxiety about. This is not normal, it’s the GAD talking.”

I second the suggestion to talk to your manager about your workload and potentially delegating some tasks.

In all other cases, the following clauses will apply.

>the introduction by the Employer of equipment or material of a different nature than that previously utilized,
>and
>a change in the Employer’s operation directly related to the introduction of that equipment or material.

>24.03 Both parties recognize the overall advantages of technological change and will, therefore, encourage and promote technological change in the Employer’s operations. Where technological change is to be implemented, the Employer will seek ways and means of minimizing adverse effects on employees which might result from such changes.

>24.04 The Employer agrees to provide as much advance notice as is practicable but, except in cases of emergency, not less than one hundred and eighty (180) days’ written notice to the Alliance of the introduction or implementation of technological change when it will result in significant changes in the employment status or working conditions of the employees.

>24.05 The written notice provided for in clause 24.04 will provide the following information:

>the nature and degree of the technological change;
>the date or dates on which the Employer proposes to effect the technological change;
>the location or locations involved;
>the approximate number and type of employees likely to be affected by the technological change;
>the effect that the technological change is likely to have on the terms and conditions of employment of the employees affected.

>24.06 As soon as reasonably practicable after notice is given under clause 24.04, the Employer shall consult meaningfully with the Alliance concerning the rationale for the change and the topics referred to in clause 24.05 on each group of employees, including training.

>24.07 When, as a result of technological change, the Employer determines that an employee requires new skills or knowledge in order to perform the duties of the employee’s substantive position, the Employer will make every reasonable effort to provide the necessary training during the employee’s working hours without loss of pay and at no cost to the employee.",True,,1523515987.0,1523487187.0,,t3_8blb8u,t3_8blb8u,3,0,0

If you look at a more stratified and diversified environment where people are out of the office more frequently, you'll get a lot more opportunities: in these environments, a lot of jobs basically have ""be ready to act for the person above you on the org chart"" in their job description, and you'll reliably get a month or two of acting in a year, even without actively searching for opportunities to act elsewhere in the organization.

Bereavement leave can be taken following the death of an immediate family member (as defined in your collective agreement.)

For example, for the CS group: 

17.02 Bereavement leave with pay

For the purpose of this clause, immediate family is defined as father, mother, (or alternatively stepfather, stepmother or foster parent) brother, sister, step-brother, step-sister, spouse (including common-law partner residing with the employee), child (including child of common-law partner) stepchild, foster child or ward of the employee, grandparent, grandchild, father-in-law, mother- in-law, and relative permanently residing in the employee’s household or with whom the employee permanently resides.

a. When a member of the employee’s immediate family dies, an employee shall be entitled to a single bereavement period of seven (7) consecutive calendar days. Such bereavement period, as determined by the employee, must include the day of the memorial commemorating the deceased or must be taken within two (2) days following the death. During such period the employee shall be paid for those days which are not regularly scheduled days of rest for the employee. In addition, the employee may be granted up to three (3) days’ leave with pay for the purpose of travel related to the death.

b. An employee is entitled to up to one (1) day’s bereavement leave with pay for the purpose related to the death of his son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law and grandparent of spouse.

c. It is recognized by the parties that the circumstances that call for leave in respect of bereavement are based on individual circumstances. On request, the deputy head of a department may, after considering the particular circumstances involved, grant leave with pay for a period greater and/or in a manner different than that provided for in clauses 17.02(a) and (b).

d. If, during a period of sick leave, vacation leave or compensatory leave, an employee is bereaved in circumstances under which he or she would have been eligible for bereavement leave with pay under paragraphs 17.02(a) or (b), the employee shall be granted bereavement leave with pay and his or her paid leave credits shall be restored to the extent of any concurrent bereavement leave with pay granted.

Done perfunctorily, without a lot of effort, they're meaningless. There are definitely managers who grade inflate too, though we've had word that grading will be scrutinized in my department this year (no giving your entire team S+ or S-, for example).

If done right, I do think it's a good value to manager and employee, as valuable as report cards can be to students.

Both can get a sense of what expectations are and how the manager feels they need to be met. This is critical to turning job descriptions into employee activities. The PMP is where the rubber hits the roads, so to speak, and where that gets documented.

I like to use it as an opportunity as well to get each of my reports to summarize their half/year. As part of our discussion, we frequently add to that as well---two people remember better than just one. That's valuable too, I think, and important to quantify the grading. Did they get more done than anticipated or more than their description would require? That evidence of an S+. Were they late or did they miss a few things? Maybe that's an S-. In any case, this provides part of the ranking.

The part I do before our review is the less tangibles (but still in their critera). Typically these are communication, teamwork and (particular to our work) quality management and health and safety. Again I document, and explain/discuss my thoughts during the review, again so that this can be included in the ranking.

Then, based on that evidence/documentation, we discuss the ranking I've assigned and why.

Finally, I discuss with the employee how they might improve their ranking for the next 6-month cycle. This will be very concrete: you need to do x, y, z. For over-performers, these are ""stretch goals"", for under-performers, this might even include a formal performance improvement plan with deadlines and milestones. This portion of the discussion also includes the employees thoughts too, where they want their job to go, what ambitions they might have in terms of advancement, mostly so that I can make sure they get training they might need, or put it on the wishlist of possibles if resources allow. I certainly don't force them to tell me what their plans are, but do let them know that I want to help if I can, and a number of taken me up on that for training or for new work opportunities.

2. Procurement/PSPC also has to be ready to actually enforce contract terms. Existing contract redress mechanisms are more than limited.

For example, there was a robust discussion about how IT and technical projects are managed, assigned and rolled up -- but that's not just about IT projects, is it? To get to the root of that, we need to talk about management of this type throughout the entire public service, and that thread goes *deep*:

Consider that, outside of the security and intelligence departments and agencies, it seems like people are much likelier to get into the executive grades starting from EC than they are from any other occupational group. (Indeed, several departments have explicit pathways and programs to this effect.) This results in a managerial class which tends to come from the NCR-focused policy side, and it's not at all uncommon to find committees of Directors General or ADMs who have spent virtually their whole careers in EC -> EX within the NCR.

This has knock-on effects when it comes to thinking about how targets are set, how projects are managed, how problems are viewed and prioritized, and which constituencies within the public service get heard -- problems which aren't helped by the decision to treat functions like IT as services delivered by vendors instead of embedded functions which are intrinsic to the business. If, throughout your career, you're systematically conditioned to view IT as a utilitarian service provided by another branch or division (instead of as a partner who can help improve your business and make your life easier), then when you yourself make it to a corner office on the 19th floor, how likely are you to give IT a seat at the table when you pursue a project with implications for them? Do you consult with them and consider their perspective from the very beginning, or do you nail down your requirements and expectations with a team of other executives with similar backgrounds, then start requesting quotes, the same as you would with any other extrinsic vendor? (Or, hey, maybe you even decide to farm it out to a consultant: why waste you time on something so far outside your knowledge, understanding and interest?)

But. But! That story's not just about IT.

Finance professionals, especially those who work on the operations end, are *also* hungry for a seat at the table.  So are people who work in staffing. Training and Development specialists are in the same boat, along with virtually *every*body in the regions, among others. These people have been raising concerns and complaints along these lines for decades. If we ""solve"" the IT problem by, like, creating more pathways for IT professionals to become EXes, we've ignored the deeper structural issue.

*Fixing* that structural issue involves rethinking the whole pathway to management, the way working departments interact with ""non-business"" units, the way that ""non-business"" units view themselves, the corporate culture in the public service, the wisdom of saving money by consolidating features and acculturating people to view them as internal vendors, the relationship between headquarters and the regions... and, like, good luck fixing all that.",True,,1522988495.0,1522959695.0,,t3_8a2ssb,t3_8a2ssb,18,0,0

There is certainly no shortage of talent, nor resources to achieve IM/IT modernization initiatives, but we are not assigning the right people to the right jobs, because...seniority gets first pick of files, and... because someone wants to have their name on a high profile project, even though they lack the knowledge and experience required. Also, please stop politicizing all projects. It's not necessary and creates undue fear, pressure and constraints.

Recently, there was an admission that Phoenix was managed as an IT project instead of a transformation / change management project which would have integrated multiple other factors, including resistance to change by end users.

Also, even if we manage to implement a working system, in all fairness, it's not feasible to ask someone who has been pushing paper and using rubber stamps - literally - for 30 years to all of a sudden have to learn six to ten, possibly more, digital applications and keep up with the newer generation(s). This could have, and should have, been taken into consideration, if managed as a transformation project. I would suggest that the same is true for all IT initiatives.

What used to be live applications aged out in the 2000s and have now simply been replaced by static .csvs and shapefiles in Open Data. It's really pathetic when I look at what my US colleagues are able to accomplish. Even at the state levels where funding levels are much lower than our service.
2. E-mail post-transformation is significantly slower and less reliable than when the servers were located at our headquarters. And yet every time I point this out someone will invariably tell me that I'm wrong about that.
3. Near every terrible Phoenix story (lack of pay for students, people not being paid on leave, etc...) we've experienced in my directorate. The human costs have been high. We're still paying them.
4. The shared drives have actually been improving in the past year, both in speed and reliability. We got an increase in space recently that only took 6 months and less than a dozen followups to process.
5. The choice to to a java application for a cross-platform identity (MyKey) seems to be one of the classic awful IT gong-shows that can only result of too many committees with too little knowledge or concern for how anything works in practice.
6. The disconnect between between IT and the rest of the service is absolutely deadly. this is one barrier I would change if given a magic wand for a day. SSC is perceived almost universally, even our departmental IT, as the enemy to getting the job done; remote, unaccountable, arbitrary and capricious in their decision making (approvals etc..). Neither outcomes or timelines for anything are predictable. The only office worse to deal with in government is the Pay Centre. To be fair, TB is actually responsible for at least some of the problems on the policies side, but as the boots on the ground SSC gets all the blame. 
7. The policy of not allowing embedded CS people is baffling. Why is it so bad that programs could be self-supporting for application development or data warehousing? In cases where that happens informally (where we've managed to pry loose programming capability, usually scientists who are double trained, and ~~data centres~~ ~~servers~~ workstations), systems have continued to be high-functioning, even to be able to offer capabilities to other groups. Where we have to officially access development through ""program groups"" we've almost been universally disappointed with the results.

Looks like the decline is tied to sunsetting of extra resources committed to EI processing. Details here: https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/reports/departmental-plan/2018/planned-results.html#h2.3

The FTE reductions are mostly in program 2.1 (Skills and Employment) and the notes say the following:

>Human resources (Full-time equivalents [FTEs])
>2017-2018: 9,120
>2018-2019: 8,434
>2019-2020: 8,291
>The main reason for the reduction in FTEs is the sunsetting of Employment Insurance workload funding. This is temporary funding received by the Department to offset volume increases. The figures cited in this report do not reflect any future decisions that the Government may or may not take to renew funding.

As to exactly *how* those reductions occur, it's hard to tell, but my guess would be ending term employment for any term employees who are ""sunset funded"" under that program. ",True,,1522900112.0,1522871312.0,,t3_89sgd1,t3_89sgd1,4,0,0

For example this government spends billions of dollars and a lot of it is done through transfer payments. If the Conservatives win the next election, they would likely get elected with a deficit reduction platform, and those positions would become at risk. If the billions flowed through new programs with full staff (for infrastructure it means engineers, architects, technicians, procurement, project management, policy experts and analysts, etc.)  then if those programs were eliminated and most likely not replaced, there would be layoffs like we had a few years ago.

People retiring may alleviate this, and another mandate of large deficits if the Liberal Party is re-elected (or if the NDP wins) would likely delay but make it worse 4 years later. 

There are also the questions of economics, with all the trade wars Trump is starting, the NAFTA renegotiation, etc. who knows what the economy will look like in two years? If we are going through a recession a conservative government would have to keep spending money, likely for infrastructures, which may require hiring more people.

So trends are not that easy to see coming. Each occupational group is also different, with task automation we may not need as many CRs and AS-01, there may be a new powerful software that works better than lawyers, passport employees at the counter may be replaced with self-service screens like at McDonald's...

I created a short procedure for new employees about the process I had to go through. I'll just mention that there are health benefits and dental benefits. You become eligible to apply for health benefits on the day you became and indeterminate employee. You become eligible for dental 3 months after the day you became indeterminate, and you are automatically enrolled. (It may take more than 3 months for dental as the pay centre is having issues with automatic enrolment for new employees. It's always good to call and check up.) For your public service health care plan(PSHCP), follow the procedure below:

1.	First call the pensions office at 1-800-561-7930 and ask for your pensions number. (You'll need your PRI to confirm identity).

2.	If they tell you that they don’t have your pensions number, it may be because they haven’t updated your file in the system as indeterminate. In that case, you’ll have to call the pay centre (phoenix) at 1-855-686-4729 and open a ticket to have your employment status updated.

Note: You’ll have to wait a week or two until they send the updated information to the pensions office. The pensions office will then generate a pensions number for you.

3.	After you obtain your pensions number by calling the pensions office again, complete these two forms: 

http://www.pshcp.ca/media/1688/emp-applic-adhes-006491.pdf

http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/remuneration-compensation/services-paye-pay-services/form/documents/446-5-v5-eng.pdf

Note: Leave section 4 of the 446-5 document blank as you don’t need a manager to apply on your behalf for a health application.

4.	Email both of them to centredepaye.paycentre@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca and CC your manager. You will receive a confirmation email that they've received your application.

Once they’ve processed your request, you will receive a letter in the mail with your certificate number (this will be a unique number just for you) and you contract number (055555).

5.	Use your certificate and contract number to complete positive enrolment from the Sun Life website. 

After completing positive enrolment, you’ll receive a confirmation letter by mail and finally (possibly a few weeks later), obtain your PSHCP benefit card.

You did say Booth St, but as far as I'm concerned it really depends if that's going to be the NRC/Public Health Agency buildings closer to the Dow's Lake side, or if it's more of a Canadian War Museum side near Lebreton Flats area for your commute.

The former (Dow's Lake side) I only know that coming from the South End is completely clear, the West-End you can take the 417 and get off at Rochester, but coming from Hull, you may have to deal with traffic on Bronson/Preston/Booth/Rochester and the two intersections of Somerset and Gladstone.

It's definitely worse for Quebec people coming into Ontario, IMO, and even at 630 it's noticeable (but definitely less so than at 8am or later). That being said, it kind of depends on WHERE in hull you live. If you are close to the bridge, even with traffic you are looking at a rapid commute. If you are ""deep"" in Hull, then it might become more of an issue. If you aren't overly attached to your car, I'd say you can avoid the headache of traffic by just walking, if you live close enough. It is actually pretty nice because you walk past the Chaudière falls. In warmer weather you can bike, and it's pretty hilly so it's a nice little workout! I walk in all weather and obviously it's not as fun in -20 than it is in sunny +15, but you just have to learn to check the weather and dress for the occasion. 

Also as for the cost savings, you're gonna wanna look into the cost and availability for parking. Parking in areas with lots of government workers can be EXPENSIVE.

Three bases to work from:

1. Even if your experience isn't *great*, being able to say something like ""I worked for four months doing work equivalent to an EC-01"" can make a hiring manager's job much easier. Play this angle up.
2. You're in a strong position to seek agency or casual employment. These are far from ideal (no job security, limited prospects, no training or development, etc.), but they let you keep a foot in the door, get you out of your current boss' hands, and anyone with government experience (even FSWEP or trivial clerical experience) is at an advantage in seeking it.
3. If you can find a manager who wants to hire you, you can be bridged in. (Bridging is an option exclusively open to former co-op and FSWEP students by which a manager can basically point at you and say ""you're hired"", without applying for anything or going through a process or any of that other rigmarole. There's no expiry date, either: if it takes you two years to meet this manager, that's fine, you'd still be eligible for bridging.)

Mainly because they are not reliable long term. Most will move up, take an assignment, or return to school full-time. It's unfortunate for those starting out. My advice would be to show initiative, be proactive, and bring forward solutions (rather than just contacting your manager with problems). Basically show you have worth and potential. Don't play on your smartphone at your desk, or browse the internet all day. It sounds silly, but starting out you need to indulge in a lot of 'make work' projects to demonstrate your trying to make a difference. Network with coworkers professionally, not socially. Your manager basically isn't looking out for your best interest, they want to keep you in the same position. However, your coworkers may take notice of your efforts and recommend you to other managers or to apply on various positions. It's easy to be jaded by the beurocracy, but just keep working hard and pump out exceptional products and deliverables. Look at the requirements for the position you really want and try and work towards gaining experience to meet those qualifications. Basically, perform at a level higher than what you were hired to do, and it will be easier to land where you want to go. Remember you are still starting out, so stay humble. I've seen a few younger workers do the bare minimum, act like they know everything and then bitch that they're not getting anywhere. 


Also, you don't need to use your direct manager as a reference. In some cases that can backfire on career advancement. Again, it's not often you encounter a manager who's willing to give up their employees. Also be mindful some managers can be good at their jobs meeting all the tasks they have to deliver to their bosses, and lack the skills of managing people.

As to the logistics, there is no such thing as an indeterminate “box”. There are just boxes, and they might be filled with a term employee or with an indeterminate employee. So a “rollover” is just an indeterminate appointment to the same position that you’re already occupying as a term. 

The paperwork for a roll-over is minimal - just confirmation that the employee has worked for the department for the required time (three years) without a break in service longer than 60 consecutive calendar days, confirmation that the person still meets the security/language requirements of the position, and a formal offer letter.

This may not seem relevant to a question like this, but you have to get the context. Something like 15% of public servants in Ottawa are formally acting in another job, and many more are doing so informally. The public service is full of people doing work which, 30 years ago, would have been assigned to 2-3 people, and a great many specialists find themselves bogged down in clerical and administrative work which often represents a poor use of their time. (Textbook example: instead of hiring a clerk to support a team of 12 social workers, we make them do their own clerical work: their own filing, their own travel planning, their own financial forecasting and reconciliation, their own paperwork, etc. This shows up as a cost savings in Ottawa [we eliminated a clerical job!], but it also means that we're paying people $40/hour to file pieces of paper [instead of paying that clerk $16/hour], and it means that each of them has fewer hours a week to devote to the actual meat of their work.)

And this type of documentation and disciplining is time-intensive, emotionally draining and often disproportionate to the difficulty caused by someone's incompetence.

Like, let's say you manage a team of 3 people. One of those people only does half as much work as the other two. Those other two are going to feel the increase in workload, be hyperaware of this person's incompetence, and it's going to manifest in poor outputs. Management needs to take action.

What if you manage a team of 20, with one incompetent person? Most of your people wouldn't notice an increase in workload. It's unlikely this will manifest as a measurable decrease in the quality of outputs. They might be aware of the incompetence in their midst, and this might have impacts upon morale, but they wouldn't be as stark as the team of 3 I just discussed.

In the latter environment, is the need to discipline this person ever going to be the most important thing a manger could be doing with their day? Because their day's already full *without* this additional work and worry: they're already pulling 10-hour days just to keep on top of their ordinary workload. And if the situation's basically functional (it sucks to have an incompetent person along for the ride, but things are chugging along), do you really want to dedicate time and effort to this?

This does create a tolerance for incompetence, and it's bad. It makes us look bad. It encourages under-performance in others. (Well, if Janet's going to leave half an hour early every single day, why am I still sitting here?) It degrades our performance as a whole. But, again, management is already by and large working themselves silly just to keep the lights on, and doesn't really have an incentive to move a task like this to the top of their pile.

Secondarily, this culture of understaffing has two impacts upon HR:

1. HR is usually one of the most skeletal teams at a department, and they tend to be so understaffed and bogged down that it routinely takes more than a year to fill even an entry-level vacancy. If you fire someone, it might be 18 months before you get a replacement for them -- and that's 18 months of active follow-up, maybe churning through 4-5 different HR contacts, of reviewing dozens of applicant files, of designing exams... it's not 18 months of idle waiting, it's yet more work on your part.
2. Some departments are *extremely* aggressive about shutting down vacant positions. This, combined with the prior point, means that vacating a box may mean it disappears altogether: ""Well, this position has been vacant for a year, and you're doing just fine, so obviously you don't really need it. We're closing the position.""

Both of these things can spook managers out of taking action, even when they feel it's justified and necessary, because they'd rather have an incompetent warm body in the position than lose the position altogether, or have to go a year or longer waiting for it to be filled.

In other words, counterintuitive as it sounds, I think one of the best fixes for public-sector incompetence is to staff the public sector appropriately: give managers the administrative and clerical support they need in order to free themselves up for higher-order tasks; ensure that managers can find time in their schedules for Good Ideas which aren't necessarily immediate priorities (including this type of staff discipline); and ensure that managers aren't pressured to keep people around just because they're worried about losing the box or being shortstaffed for ages and ages and ages while it gets filled.",True,,1521966489.0,1521937689.0,,t3_86voih,t3_86voih,54,0,0

- They know their collective agreements inside and out (better than the policies, rules and regulations required to do their jobs)
- They know how the system works - i.e. no one is going to do anything.

**Many Different Reasons for Why No One Takes Action:** 

- They have seen how difficult the process is, which usually ends up going nowhere,
- Are unwilling to rock the boat after years of trying to get the coveted management position - which as it turns out isn't as exciting as they thought it would be,
- Aren't able to justify why they provided no training, failed to document issues etc.,
- Are tired, getting older, have a mortgage, wife and kids, and just want to ride out the rest of their time in peace so they can retire and finally start living,
- Are weak and just want to keep the masses happy and have everyone adore them,
- Are insecure and like to surround themselves with people who are weaker and more incompetent.
- The same union that represents middle managers, also represents the employee.
- Aren't comfortable with having difficult conversations and don't really know where to turn for appropriate advice. 

I want to reiterate that this is not the norm, and there are some extremely hard working individuals who regularly go above and beyond to keep things afloat. Sadly, it's this other group that ends up tarnishing and overshadowing the image of all public servants.

Early 2015, I get told that since I didn't have my last class done (hence my college degree) back when the pool start, I won't be considered. I was shattered.


Learned later that the poster actually said degree **or** 2 years. Sigh... I got fucked.


Fast forward some more time, Sept 2015. <Department B> calls me. They need me to replace their tech for 3 months (surgery). I busted by ass for 3 months. Somewhere in December, Team Lead tells me his manager will have a poster shortly, to apply and he'd put in a good word. Which he did. Did the interview, etc. Landed a 2 years term. (They actually had to move a job position from Ottawa to my region). Started on Halloween 2016. I busted my ass for a whole year and they made me indeterminate. I was in shock. I kept on pushing and I'm now CS02.


I guess this doesn't really explain how hard it is to get an indeterminate CS01, but I just want you to know that, it's a bit of a case-by-case, some departments (In my case Department A) are filled up with ~~lazy-boomers-close-to-retirement~~ management that just wants to do as little as possible until then. They won't stand or fight for you, they won't help you. But there are genuinely good managers out there that will.

Most managers are going to follow specific template SoMC forms but they could also make up their own.

The references are being contacted in order to validate your self-assessment scores. I believe they take an average of the two (your score, and your references' assessment. Not sure.)

Once they get the results they need to determine right-fit through resumé reviews and interviews. SSC HR has given managers very little guidance on what to do, so people are kind of figuring it out. Managers only got access to this in mid-January even though the applications were taken in November.

I think the worst offenders in terms of creating a climate of fear are those with serious ego and self-esteem issue. Once you stop seeing life and what others say or think as a threat to your sense of self, you don't have to scream and behave like a four year old. It's okay to realize that you are stupid and will make dumb mistakes. The first thing I tell people who work for me is: if I'm being stupid or a dumbass, tell me. Nobody has but will come in my office when they think a bad decision is being made (even if I'm the one making the dumb decision) and often time they're right. 

I've had my share of being right pissed at the higher ups and having to deal with decisions that were dumb and it is frustrating to pass those down the chain of command, but it is NEVER okay to lose your shit. Even more so on people under your authority. The second you do, you've just lost a whole lot of credibility and have failed. 

When people lose their shit, it's because they've run out of intelligent things to say. As a manager, you have tons of resources to address problems with employees. None of them require screaming or behaving like a toddler. I've seen loads of personality issuses in the private sector too. Power trippers and people with sociopathic traits are everywhere. They're just a bit harder to fire in the public sector. What adds to this problem is that helping someone move on elsewhere rather than applying disciplinary methods can be easier, which is a problem. 

There are places in the public service with awesome work environments and camaraderie. I was lucky to have a first government boss who was into pranks and joking around. I've also worked for a small program where the director was almost like a second mother (have it on good authority she helped someone move in to a new house and was right anxious when any employee was female and single and was late in the morning, afraid something bad happened) and where corporate retreats meant quasi parties in the evening.

Maybe you were hired in a competition for one team and some other manager piggy-backed on it? Having seen a bit how it worked internally, I once applied for job where I was interviewed by one unit, got qualified for the level, only to end up being hired by another unit months later.

If it keeps going, give it a career development spin, tell your managers that you want to develop skills and gain increased responsibilities and see what else you could do. Public service will very often be dull and slow (lots of red tape, consultations, etc.). I think the best way to deal with it is to focus on yourself, really.

**A Few Home Truths:**
The reason there are so few millenials is because by the time they make it through the lengthy hiring process, they are:

- Already in their 30s.
- Disillusioned that the job wasn't as advertised.
- Surprised at the number of jaded workers who literally have a pension countdown clock on their desk (will that be me some day?)
- Still unaware of the benefits of a stable job and raising a family in a city like Ottawa. This only comes into focus after they've lived a little, bought the T-shirt, and are well into their 30s. 

In my humble opinion, there is too much focus on recruiting *millenials*, when the focus should be on recruiting *specific skill sets* which will propel GoC into the 21st century; it's much more inclusive and far more effective in the long run [*If you build it, they will come*] Having said that, generally speaking and by default, it's mostly millenials who will possess the KSA's relating to emerging technologies.

Although it looks PC on paper and on org charts, the reality of many positions are not always reflective... no matter how good the intentions are. Working in the NCR where most public service jobs are has an added barrier of French/English bilingualism (which is not an accurate reflection of our country as a whole). This only seems to promote a small group of a  privileged population where French language was a social part of their lives. Work experience and post secondary education are also added layers of barriers for many positions. Not to mention the increase of retired workers returning to the work force to occupy many of the part time positions. I regularly see good workers being trapped in lower levels and mediocre workers being elevated to higher positions and added benefits. Occupational needs are not accurately reflective of the needs. Many new employees are confronted with so much beurocracy, minimal training and archaic tools: they're set up to fail and they lose motivation and are rarely provided opportunities. The lower level positions are not sustainable to be occupied long term, and in turn, have a heavier level of turnover. Not to mention many of those positions were and still are heavily affected by Phoenix pay issues. Not many managers invest in the younger workers, but many younger workers aren't showing much initiative either. I've tried delegating some tasks to allow younger workers gain experience and demonstrate some proactive initiative, but only find many of them fail by either rushing to complete but result in many errors, or lack to complete the tasks and occupy their time playing on their phones and socializing. I try pointing some of these situations as examples to them as learning experience. Some appreciate it, others couldn't care. The public service is also poisoned with many opportunists who bleed the benefits and take advantage of self victimization. They will take as many sick days off because they are entitled to them, and find ways to take additional time off with pay (stress leave, parental leave, income averaging,etc).

For the PSHCP, you can see the [employer rate](https://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/d9/v9/s87/en#s87-tc-tm_4) from the Health Care Plan Directive; the taxable benefit is the amount listed there times 1.09 to account for a Québec sales tax on insurance premiums.

For the PSDCP, there are yearly [information notices](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/information-notice/quebec-taxable-benefits-2017-2018-rates.html) published defining the effective employer rates.  

If you're interested in calculating the QIT withholding per-paycheque using Revenu Québec's formulas, then you will need to include these employer-paid amounts alongside your salary for determining taxable income (for QIT and QPP, but not QPIP).

The Box J amount should also be approximately equal to the sum of the year-total PSHCP and PSDCP ""Employer Paid Benefits"" amounts, from the last pay-stub of the year.

Note that when you go to file your taxes, the Box J amount is considered an eligible medical expense for the respective Québec tax credit.  Between the employer-paid premiums and any medical expenses not fully covered by insurance (such as the 20% not covered for many treatments/drugs), it's comparatively easy to exceed the 3%-income threshold for claiming the tax credit.",True,,1521229699.0,1521200899.0,,t3_84u5kj,t3_84u5kj,5,0,0

The amount was not large by any means (less than $200). I followed up with the department claim officer once in a while, but it's really a waiting game. The department claim officer is just a point of contact designated by TBS. For example, the claim officer in my agency is the Financial Controls Director, but I mostly exchanged emails with a few of her employees.

The claim was analysed by her team, it seems like they work with templates issued by TBS. They calculated exactly how much money I was owed (I was missing a few hundred dollars per pay check) by using my Phoenix paystubs and my letter of offer, they looked at my credit statement to see how much interest I'm paying on my line of credit and allowed a reimbursement for the precise amount I was owed. For example, I was underpaid by about $1,100 per pay check. So if I had a $2,000 debt on my line of credit, they calculated how much interest I paid on the first $1,100 and approved this amount. Then they request permission from TBS to issue a reimbursement.

My claim was partially approved. I find it incredibly funny that a CPA and a few of her account payable assistants had to sift through my pay stubs, my credit line statements and calculate the exact amount. Complete waste of their time….

At the end of the day, I didn’t accept the reimbursement. The reimbursement is processed as a *claim against the Crown*, similar to if a public servant damages a car while going to a meeting or if you break something in your hotel room while on travel duty. The government will settle with the claimants, as directed by the *Directive on Payments*. The last step before issuing a payment is to obtain a release from the claimant, which states that the government accept no responsibility, liability or cause on the parts covered by the claim and bars the claimant from pursuing any legal actions, grievances, court orders or anything related to the portion settled by the reimbursement. I refused to sign this release and it was been sitting on their desks for the last few months.

I recommend having a solid rationale and writing a good claim statement. You have to be thorough and explain everything, as you would in a grievance. You also have to provide statements or proof to support your claim. I don’t know what you’ll need to support your case, but it’s more than just a written statement. The claim officer can probably answer your questions. If you don’t receive a reply in a reasonable timeline, don’t hesitate to contact their bosses.

Just make sure the agency is actually doing the staffing based on a actual competition and not for their own benefit. Staffing agencies are notorious for getting people through sometimes bogus jobs possibilities or ‘pools’ only to increase their own list of people who they then offer subcontracts through their agency (ie. It doesn’t lead to a gig where the goc is the direct employer). 

Staffing agencies are parasites - they collect a boatload of money and the person doing to work sees a fraction. Ive taken a few of these exams and they’re nothing like a real ps exam.

They have an independent review board for their own promotion system somewhat unique in the service. Roughly comparable to a university faculty member; requires not just a Ph.D., but also a further academic pedigree, including postdoc research experience. The prototypical subject matter expert (SME) job. Senior RES-5 scientists are expected to be global leaders in their field. SE RES classes cannot be management.

**SE REM** - The ""Research Manager"" who is supposed to manage SE RES positions. Generally requires a post graduate degree in science. EX-1 and EX-2 equivalents.

**PC** - ""Physical scientists"" - A general catchall for physical, geological, environmental science and science related activity. Some are lab jobs, many are not. A broad category that can range from pure research, to field inspections to regulation-driven routine lab work, to a desk job dealing with science policy, and even some inter-governmental and international work. Often SMEs/departmental spokespeople at senior ranks. Uniquely, unlike the other SPI classes, the top end are director-level equivalents. They require a BSc, but many have post graduate degrees.

**BI** - ""Biological Scientists"", similar to the PC class, but dealing with biology, life and heath sciences. Again, a broad class, including bench scientists, scientific regulators, science policy workers and even foreign service delegates. Again, often SMEs at the senior ranks.

**CH** - ""Chemistry"", the bench chemist, usually in a routine, regulatory service role (e.g. measuring air pollution, but not doing direct research), though certainly not exclusively. Large overlaps with the PC class. They require a BSc, but many have post graduate degrees.

**AG** - ""Agriculture Scientists"", very similar to the BI class, specific for agricultural/farm research and policy. Almost all in Agriculture and CFIA. They require a BSc, but many have post graduate degrees.

**FO** - ""Forestry"", very similar to the BI class, again very specific to a few departments like NRCan. They require a BSc, but many have post graduate degrees.

**MT** - ""Meterologists"", A narrow class particular mostly to ECCC, and then only to a single branch, the Meteorological Service of Canada. BSc. minimum, and often highly trained in IT as well. They do the weather and associated tasks like climate change modelling.

**EG** - ""Engineering and Scientific Support"" The laboratory technician role. These people often do labwork, supervised by one of the more senior science roles, SE-RES, CH, BI, AG, MT, FO, or PC. Some EG roles are science-related, but desk jobs, things like waste management and quality control. Higher levels may be supervisory, but the top end is below executive levels. Education is typically a college certificate, though university degrees are common too.

Note that due to the large overlap and slightly incompatible pay and ex-equivalency scales between the various Applied Science and Patent Examination - Applied Science classes (PC & CH) and (BI, AG, & FO), there's some pressure from TB to collapse or reduce use of some of the classes.

I agree that completing your MA at an Ottawa university will put you at an advantage if you have a compulsory co-op (which gives you experience and the opportunity to bridge in); for me, however, I only wanted to complete my MA in one year and I wanted it paid for entirely. I went to a perfectly respectable university for my MA (but not as highly regarded as my undergraduate alma mater) and received $20,000 in funding.

Old job had only an rrsp match, no other benefits. Also, while nothing imminent was going to change, the 5 year outlook was murky, I didn’t have a good sense of what else I would want to do, or be able to transition to if the company folded.
A Term with the public service offfered no guarantees, but possibility to extend (has happened) or apply internally. While my current position is very basic, as a 28 year old the benefits/pension made the jump too logical to pass up. While I don’t regret the decision, there are many days I would prefer to be doing my old job. Your situation is different. You enjoy your job, have exciting things happening, and have benefits. If you take a term, there is no guarantee of a job past your end date until one materializes. Also, unless you know the job is exactly up your alley, and you think you will like your new team, there are lots of possible things that could make you dream of going back to your old job. 
Is there a right answer? Probably not. If you don’t have financial obligations that could be problematic if a term doesn’t work out, and you think a change would be interesting, go for it. If you enjoy what you do, you haven’t mentioned much that indicates any real advantage to making a change.

Grievances are slow, invasive, career-limiting and public. Which is to say that their only really ""good"" use is for asserting either a human right, a labour right, or a right granted by a collective agreement, and even then only if you want to do so with a sledgehammer. (""My boss is sexually harassing me and I don't feel my reports of this behavior are being taken seriously."" ""The way my manager described me in these emails is completely unprofessional and unacceptable and clearly illustrates that she actively creates a toxic work environment, but when I spoke with her about it, she just laughed at me."" ""The employer is not doing nearly enough to accommodate my disability, and this lack of reasonable accommodation adversely impacts my performance."" ""The elevators in my building are so poorly-maintained that my workplace is becoming unsafe. Last week, someone was trapped in one for 90 minutes!"")

Grievances and formal complaints are usually not suitable for resolving personality conflicts, addressing personal circumstances (unless these circumstances are mediated by one of the rights I've alluded to), or ""getting back"" at someone or something -- and if you think you can put in a ""minor"" or ""gentle"" grievance, forget it.

This is not to discourage you from using them if they're an appropriate tool: many of the rights we now enjoy in the workplace flowed directly from people picking up that sledgehammer and using it hard.",True,,1520577710.0,1520548910.0,,t3_831iml,t3_831iml,26,0,0

The grievance was successful and management actually removed the manager from her job and moved her to another area.  So I can speak from experience that they are a useful mechanism but it isn't a magic solution either.  I did not experience limits to my career as I went on to three other promotions.  Grievances which are flimsy or without foundation could certainly be seen as putting the grievor in a negative light.  There is another mechanism called Informal-Conflict Resolution which is a semi-formal method and can involve a mediator between yourself and your manager.  It is recommended before a grievance for sure if the area of disagreement is harassment.  If it's the classification of your position, there are classification grievances and my relationship with HR does not indicate to me that people who grieve their classification are seen by HR labour relations as trouble makers.  A difficult employee who grieves will certainly continue to be seen as a difficult employee.  It's not the grievance that will make it worse.  So in the end, a grievance should be used judiciously.  I've only done it once in 30 years.  I put in a harassment complaint against a colleague for sexist remarks (yet women can be sexist as well) which resulted in management ordering the colleague to cease and desist with no negative repercussions to me.

I've been on the periphery of a multi-part process now for several years, which I won't describe. The complainant has partially gotten what they want, though at the cost of burning their bridges with their management and the department. If they were asked however, I don't think they'd claim to be happy with the outcomes. Management doesn't have to do what the complainant asks to address a grievance, and the outcomes of those decisions may not always be what was originally desired.

There has been spill-over good and bad from the original set of complaints and the subsequent ones. Mostly though it has chewed up a lot of time and resources on everyone's part: complainant, management, other staff, unions.

The process is a big deal, similar in some ways to going to court (I've been part of cases, for work, which were far less involved). It will be career-altering. I'd want to be certain that it's worth it.

I have read through a *lot* of the staffing complaints that reach the Public Service Labour Relations and Employment Board (PSLREB). A few observations on those decisions:

* They normally take a *long* time. It’s not unusual for the decision date to be 3-4 years after the appointment.

* The majority of the cases that are heard by the board are dismissed. While every case is decided on its individual facts, there is a high bar required to prove something like “abuse of authority”. 

* The result of the complaint rarely results in anything that directly benefits the person who made the complaint. That person doesn’t typically get the job as a result of their complaint. At most, an appointment could be set aside and the department ordered to run a new staffing process.

On the whole, given the stress and time involved I don’t think they are particularly useful. That said, many of the complaints get resolved informally long before they reach the board, and those resolutions might be more beneficial to the complainant.

To summarize: 

* 3 weeks vacations; 4 weeks after 8 years.

* 15 days sick leave

* 1 volunteer day and 1 personal day.

* Pension you have to work until you're 60 years old with 30 years of service; if you are under 30 this means you will do more than 30 years. Pension will be average best 5 consecutive years salary x 2% (e.g. if your average is $50,000 after 30 years you get 2% x 30 (60%) of that salary which gives you $30,000). You will also pay CPP/QPP so overall you pension and retirement payments will take a large sum, but keep in mind you're buying peace of mind for later.

* Healthcare insurance starts on day 1 but not sure how you register. Dental insurance starts after 3 months.

* If unionized you don't have to join the union but you must still pay for it.

I got reliability clearance first, with the idea that it would be quicker, and was just recently upgraded to secret. The letter of offer comes after the security clearance, and I had to come back to Canada and travel to Ottawa ASAP in order to submit my security clearance forms and for them to take my fingerprints. The reliability clearance took about a month and a half (included in there the waiting time for requesting a police certificate from abroad), then my letter of offer came really soon after the clearance was granted. I submitted the clearance docs Sept 25, got my LOO Nov 2, and my first day at work was Nov 14. 

Answer to 1) have you submitted clearance forms and been fingerprinted? If not maybe starting to prepare for that by requesting police certificates from countries you've resided in for 6 months or longer over the last 10 years would be a good idea, your LOO depends in a big part on how quickly the clearance will go through. If you've applied for other jobs in the government, the police certificates are still a good idea as they'll be needed regardless. 
2) I think they will give you a date, if they don't when they send you the LOO, ask when they would like your reply.

Ideally, one should report cohabitation and legal partnerships to HR if the couple is working in the same unit or division. If separating the two is not feasible, then they should be made aware of the code of conduct and other related policies, especially within the context of personal relationships. One would hope that adults can continue to behave in a professional manner for the duration of a relationship, and also after a break up. If one or both are unable to leave the drama out of the workplace, then action must be taken immediately to avoid poisoning the work environment.

Also, while the conflict of interest is quite obvious when a couple is in a direct reporting relationship with one another, there is another more subtle conflict that *may* occur.

More and more IT security stuff is being centralized in SSC. CRA is one of those departments that likes to run their own duplicate organizations for things done elsewhere in the government but their independence as an ""Agency"" has been chiselled away over the past 7-10 years. CRA has a big ""the way we've always done it"" culture which means everything runs like clockwork and everyone knows whose job something is. Changes happen very slowly though.

SSC is probably the more interesting place to work. They are still getting a ton of funding and most of the negativity was in the past. Things can seem disorganized but that's part of the fun and opportunity to shape it, right?



That said I can't recommend to anyone take a CS-02 position over a CS-03 one. What you could do is take the CS-03 and then look for lateral move opportunities over to SSC. That's the loyalty in the public service.

I am currently a 3 within a small organization working in security. There is no shortage of work and always something to do, either policy (awareness, departmental directives etc...) or operational (new tool implementation, investigation, forensics).

So that being said, here is what I have to say on the topic:

Keeping in mind the inception of the CyberCenter which will be located in the east end most likely, but not in the Drake building (lack of room), and also the potential requirements of Enhanced TS Clearance (not the same as standard TS Clearance) - and this is still to be confirmed, there is a lot in limbo about the staffing and the transfer of responsibilities. SSC's CITS team is pretty big, going from AD Management, to Firewall/Perimeter to PKI management. What is known is that the SSC SOC/CCIRC/GC-CIRT will most likely be transferred over to this cybercenter, but not sure about the other roles. There is talks about other responsibilities, but only rumors at this time. 

That being said, when you go to SSC, you will work in one field and one field only, without touching anything else unless you move. IE: If you work in Perimeter, your sole job is managing a firewall, not the LAN/WAN or traffic. You don't do any endpoint investigation, all that goes back to the departmental IT Security team.

As for CRA, knowing they have a pretty big team and responsibility (5 pts to the person who can tell me what is CRA's primary business - it's not what you think), working in Cyber there, you will have a lot more exposure to the different technologies available that they use to maintain and manage their environment. 

But as others have mentioned, but I am not familiar with, is that as an Agency, transferring from that agency to a Core department may be a bit more trouble.

As for CS-04 uni-lingual, these are like the fable unicorn... you hear of them and may be promised one, however, with the push from OL to have senior positions or all bilingual (until the OL is reviewed to better adapt to current language requirements/flexibility) they are rare, and once a grand-fathered position is empty, OL is usually pretty quick to want to change the language requirements.

Hope this helps

All the manager did was give him only a month worth of experience and then justify it by saying the guy had ""experience in so and so"". It was shady but the New Staffing policy allows that.  With non-advertised appointments, a manager could in theory go to some random person on the street and say ""hey,do you have experience in this?"" and if yes BOOM he is hired.  While this might sound positive to some, the policy allows a manager to hire *anybody* so long as there is some sort of justification(which is not hard to do). So that's what I mean, I see the policy as too loose and unregulated and thus easily susceptible to abuse.

The policy has its merits but I think it needs to be reformed with audit measures to protect against abuse and favoritism.

Look for opportunities to grow your staffs' abilities and experience. How can you develop their competencies or stretch their limits?

A good manager realizes that there are different types of staff, with different skills and assigns work with that in mind. 

Also there are different people in terms of career aspirations and abilities. If you have a person who clearly has the skills and desire to move up, help them.  This might mean approving training that is not for their job today, but for a job they'll have in a few years.

-  It's okay to be a tough when necessary, but always be fair.
- Remember that avoidance [of a problem] is not the same as prevention.
- Practice self-awareness: check in with yourself to ensure your decisions, opinions, and behaviors aren't based on preconceived notions or biases.
- Say sorry, please, and thank you when warranted.
- You're not expected to know everything; your employees are there to support you, and will respect you more for admitting that you don't know xyz, instead of making up answers. Leverage their knowledge and expertise and make them feel valued.
- Regardless of prior friendships with your employees, you are now in a position of accountability and responsibility, and should treat all staff with respect, dignity and courtesy across the board. Nothing demoralizes an employee than a boss who openly plays favorites.
- Ask for support when you need it, and take a health break, regularly.
- Incorporate team building activities into the year to rejuvenate staff morale.
- Nip problems in the bud to avoid bigger issues in the future.
- Be fair! (yes, I've mentioned this before, but it bears repeating).

We generally do ask for this when we hire researchers, but not everyone does. We're weird in that respect apparently: we evaluate for research jobs using research criteria, which is total outside of typical HR recommendations.

You might, as a courtesy ask the panel if they want you to do a seminar. They may well say yes, and it would be an excellent chance for you to meet the team and evaluate if you want to be part of it. But a seminar can't be part of the formal evaluation process if they don't ask for it. There's nothing to lose here at all, and this shows willing on your part. Go for it.

A word of warning: this isn't going to be much about research or technical ability, for various stupid internal reasons*. Be prepared for structured behavioural interviewing. Look up the STAR technique for responding to structured interviews. I would recommend you do some practice questions too. Try to keep responses reasonably sort, less than 5 minutes or so. Say what you have to say and stop. That's what they're expecting. Do have questions for them as well about the job and any details they may not have provided info for.

Especially, do ask if this is a research job (a RES class) or if it's a ""program"" job (A BI or some other ""science"" class), if  this isn't identified on the job poster/ad. It should be, but you never know. In both cases, it's worth to ask about what level of research you might be able to expect (80:20 research mix or 50:50 or what). Ask about conference travel as well. Both of those will give you a better sense of what the job is (and whether you want it).

If you have more questions, don't hesitate to ask. I have a lot of experience with this from both sides of the interview table.

*To clarify, they can't directly ask you about education or work experience, or about your scientific skills. They will ask questions to show things like initiative, reliability, teamwork skills, etc... You absolutely can use technical and scientific examples in your response, and use that as an opportunity to talk about your research. I would definitely encourage this approach in an interview.

This would be calculated as a lifetime pension and a bridge benefit. The bridge benefit is only payable until age 65, and then it stops. 

The amount of the bridge benefit is calculated based on a formula that is supposed to roughly equate with what you'd get from CPP at age 65. It isn't exactly the same as the CPP amount, but it should be fairly close.

If the public servant applies for CPP starting at 65, their total income from the PSSA pension and CPP should be the same after 65 as it was from age 60-65, but it's up to the individual to choose when to apply for CPP.

If the person applies for CPP starting at age 60, then from age 60-65 they'd receive the PSSA lifetime pension, the bridge benefit, *and* CPP from ages 60-65. The CPP amount at age 60 would be less than at age 65, though, because it's reduced if you apply early. At age 65 the bridge benefit would end, which would feel a bit like a pay cut. 

Personally, I think there are advantages for public servants to apply for the CPP as early as they can if they retire early. The CPP is reduced if you have zero-earnings years, and there are more of those if you stop working in your 50s.

It's not a dollar for dollar reduction so if you have longer CPP service than PSSA, your CPP may exceed the amount of PSSA CPP reduction at 65.  However, those who apply for CPP after age 65 get an increased benefit for having delayed.

You shouldn't.

Once the PSEE is entirely scored and resolved (meaning that all results are unencumbered and the whole bank is ready to go), managers can start requesting referrals. These normally take three forms:

1. They can search for specific qualifications and credentials.
2. They can search by test scores.
3. They can grab people at random.

In all three cases, managers can also apply geographic filtering (""People whose on-file postal code is within 40 kilometres of Saskatoon, SK""), or search for people willing to work in a given community (""People who indicated they were willing to work in Bathurst, NB"").

If you get pegged by a request, you'll get a notification that you're a candidate for referral: this means you *might* be included in the extract which gets handed to a hiring manager. The manager will not usually consider every candidate in the referral batch: they'll filter it further by picking candidates to consider. (They might receive 40 resumes intending to only make a single hire, and why would they bother interviewing all of you?) Managers are also under no obligation to do anything with a bunch of referrals: they can generate them and decide not to hire, decide to draw on a pool instead, do the whole thing on an anticipatory basis (meaning a job might not even come available), etc. With this in mind, an invitation to be referred is unto itself pretty meaningless.

People with better scores tend to get more referrals, and more interest resulting from those referrals, than people with more mediocre scores. People with specific, easily-searchable and in-demand qualifications (CPA, Engineer, MSW, Computer Science, etc.) tend to get more referrals, and more interest resulting from those referrals, than people with more generic background. People who live near major government centres (especially Ottawa) tend to get more referrals, and more interest resulting from those referrals, than people out in the boonies.

It's actually about public and private spaces and how they have changed as a result of social media and the 24 hour news cycle.

All governments care about message control. Companies do too. There is a legitimate expectation that employees tow the company line when they are on company time.

Scientists have professional opinions and sharing them with each other is part of how they maintain their qualifications and participate in the broader scientific community. 

Before social media and the 24 hour news cycle they could do this without really influencing the media or the public. That's not true anymore.

As far as government scientists are professional scientists they need to be able to share professional opinions within their field of expertise freely, and there is a legitimate public interest in what scientists are saying to each other. As far as they are public employees, they need to respect their employer even when they disagree with them.

The way the US Government has addressed this situation is by allowing scientists to speak within their fields of expertise with a disclaimer that they are not representing the US Government. This would be a reasonable approach for Canada too. 

The media needs to be a bit more responsible about reporting what scientists say though. Scientists are experts in a very narrow field, not in everything, and while they are very important in providing advice to policy makers, they don't always make policy.

3- retiring after 35 years of pensionable service (age 58)

I used a simple RRSP calculator I found online, if you put $2,000 at a very conservative rate of 3.75% during your career, you will get $72,000 when you are 58 and 59 years old. If you keep the same percentage as your salary grows, the amount will obviously be much larger, but considering inflation, not as impressive in the 2050s.

So it's up to you, if you think you'll work until you're 60, then you wouldn't need to invest money your pension plan should be enough. Just keep in mind, if you put money in an RRSP you will save the income tax, but as you start your career, the tax rate is very low (maybe 28-32%) and if you have a good salary (let's say you become manager or an executive) the tax rate at retirement may be higher than this.

This is misleading.  Even counting only ""transactions with financial impact,"" the case level in the dashboard is 460k.  The target is then 80k as a ""normal workload.""
Since each month seems to come with its own set of special cases to justify poor progress, the 80k ""standard workload"" is also a very optimistic target.  To in fact meet its real performance standard (most cases closed within 20 days), the pay center will obviously need a running queue of less than a month's *real* work.

(In fact, it's even more pernicious than this: the benchmark is 80k transactions *with a financial impact* as a normal workload, but the claimed normal processing rate is 80k transactions full stop.

* Settling underpayment claims based on a worker's self-assessment and management's sign-off that the amount claimed is a reasonable estimate of the amount owing.

This occurred as part of the ""Deficit Reduction Action Plan"" in the 2011 and 2012 budgets - the general idea was that if departments were anticipating reductions in staffing levels (and therefore layoffs) it made little sense to automatically make temporary staff into permanent staff. 

But that was then, and this is now. Most departments have lifted the freezes, so time worked as a term now counts toward the roll-over after three years. I haven't seen term employees (particularly good ones) given the 'boot' simply because they're about to become indeterminate. In practice a lot of managers don't even understand the roll-over provisions and might not even be aware that an employee is supposed to roll over until *after* they've passed the three-year mark. 

Still, there is huge value to taking an indeterminate position if it's available to you. Indeterminate status is something that is very difficult to be taken away from you, and that stability is valuable. 

That said, if you've been offered a move into the AS stream as a term, that might be more appealing because it'll put you into the AS stream where there tend to be more opportunities, even if it's only a term job. 

A good question to ask the manager is the reason for the position being a term. Is it to back-fill a position because somebody is on leave? Or is it a sunset-funded position?

But. Two things:

1. If you'd have to go out into the regions to do it, especially if you'd be outside of major federal government centres (Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg, Halifax & Vancouver), you're taking a huge risk and may struggle to escape from the job if things go wrong. You may also struggle to find advancement opportunities. In general, I advise that people stay in the major centres unless they either get a golden once-in-a-lifetime opportunity (CR-4 to AS-4? TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT), have an occupational reason to leave (to take over a regional office, to follow a Director who's becoming a DG, because you're an inspector and the regions are where the jobs are in your world, etc.), or have non-career-related needs they hope to meet by doing so.
2. It can be very, very, *very* tough to break out of CR. CRs hit a hard shelf because their work isn't meant to leave any room for discretion: you do the exact task you've been trained to do in the exact manner you've been trained to do it. Conversely, even an AS-1 (and an AS-1 is what you'd likely want coming out of a CR-4) is meant to exercise at least a little discretion: prioritization, escalation, gatekeeping, framing, tasking, etc. This can make it deceptively difficult to acquire the sort of experience which would let you break into AS. This is especially true at entry level: there's no shortage of people who meet the basic merit criteria for a generic AS-1 position, so hiring managers have options and get to be picky. A lot of CRs (a **lot** of CRs) have war stories about this: of losing out on an AS-1 to a student they basically supervised, of working for a department for six years and doing a stellar job and still not getting any upward movement, of the way people just treat CRs in general (in some workplaces, CRs basically get treated as furniture that talks), etc.

In all cases, this isn't a decision we can make for you. Based on what you've presented here, if you're in Ottawa or one of the major centres I listed, I would likely take the CR-4. But I could go the other way, too.",True,,1518601281.0,1518572481.0,,t3_7xd57h,t3_7xd57h,7,0,0
0,du7rbks,7xd57h,t5_3f8vd,3,ottcity321,,False,t1_du7rbks,"My best advice to you is to always do what's best for you.  In your case this means taking the permanent cr4 over the ""maybe one day you will be a permanent as1"".  Waiting for three years to roll over into permanent isn't the best strategy in my opinion.  Many things can happen in those three years and circumstances may change, managers may change, and governments may change.  What is said today by a manager may not apply in the future.

Unfortunately, in the government there is always a lot of talk from managers.  Often times they will hype these type of these things in the effort to keep you.  They can say and promise permanency but unless it's on paper, their talk doesn't mean much.  Keep in mind that managers are looking after their own interests and not necessarily yours.  Understand this early on and you will go ahead in your public service career rather quickly and effortlessly. 

I understand the AS1 might be tempting.  But first focus on becoming permanent.   Take the permanent job.  There are so many AS positions in the government, so it shouldn't be too hard to jump over into an AS position from a CR position.  

Also, by you taking the CR4 permanent job this will give you the upper hand in some way.  What I mean to say is if the AS1 department really doesn't want to lose you, they will find some way to offer you a permanent position (whether its a cr or as position).  You want permanency and have to mean it!  When manager see that you are serious and mean business, they will take you much more seriously.  I have seen managers jump mountains just to keep staff that they value and want to keep around.

Point of this all, your strategy should first be becoming permanent then you can focus career progression.

After working there for a year, I was offered an NCR job with another department and took the promotion. Having worked in both environments (from a sleepy corner of an army base in the middle of nowhere, to the national headquarters of a major department), I think I have some insight here.

**Preface**: the vast majority of people I worked with at Shilo were dedicated public servants who often made heroic efforts to do the job properly, despite being under-resourced, understaffed, underfunded and structurally neglected in other ways.

In particular, I had the tremendous fortune to spend that formative year as a public servant with the most incredible supervisor in the whole government. (I'm sorry, I know this will shock some of you, but however good your supervisor is, mine was at least 20% better.) I've never met anyone so tirelessly and relentlessly dedicated to doing the right thing in the right way for the right reasons, more focused on protecting and wisely utilizing taxpayer funds and resources, more invested in the well-being of her coworkers, and more willing to go out on a limb for the sake of doing the right thing. If I grow up to be half the public servant she is, I'll consider my career a success.

But in general, I had an amazing team who taught me a ton, made me feel welcome and engaged in a world which was still totally new to me, made sure I got taken care of, and laughed at my dumb jokes. I was lucky to have the opportunity I got, an if certain things unrelated to the job had gone differently, I would still happily be there today.

-----

Okay, now for the career-limiting disclosures.

There are three key things you need to know about working as a civilian within DND:

**First**, within DND, the Chain of Command is **everything**. When you work on a military base, regardless of what you do or where you do it or who your manager is, all of your work will eventually have to bear the scrutiny of someone in green.

This has some advantages. For one thing, if you run into the common problem of having to wear four different hats for six different supervisors, having the Chain of Command around means you've always got a tiebreaker: if Mary says ""go left"", and Mark says ""go right"", and the Major says ""stand right where you are and jump"", then you jump, and you tell Mary and Mark to take it up with the Major. Sorted.

Another advantage is that your work, regardless of how esoteric it may be, will always be tied directly into the mission of the Canadian Forces. A lot of public servants sit in cubicles and push numbers around all day and never get to see any of their work make a difference. This is not a problem you'll have on a military base: even if you spend the whole day in a spreadsheet, that spreadsheet leads directly to the activities going on outside your office window: your work will matter in obvious and significant ways.

But there are downsides, starting with point two.

-----

**Two**: Most uniformed personnel get turned over every three years. If they do a good job and are on their best behaviour, they can get reassigned every eighteen months as they pinball their way up the ranks -- but most make it to three years and get rotated to a new position on a different base.

This is a tremendous contrast to the civilians.

*Some* civilians are priority spouses: they're married to a service member, and when that member gets reassigned, they go with them, using spousal priority to get a job at the other end. (Which also means that, like the uniformed personnel, they disappear to a new base every three years.)

*Most* civilians, especially in rural areas, are lifers: not only are they career public servants, but they've spent the last 27 years on this very base doing this very job. (Or maybe going from a Junior Beadle to a Beadle to a Supervising Beadle, but still basically doing the same work.)

And this relationship has some pretty heavy implications. For one thing, even if you have a civilian manager and a civilian supervisor, you're still within the Chain of Command, and you will still have a Big Boss in a uniform. He or she will only ever last three years. This means that systems and expectations can shift rapidly and significantly -- in theory. In practice, the fact that most civilians stick around forever dictates that, when the Big Boss tries to change things, the civilians often just shrug. After all, he'll be gone in a year and a half, so if we just do a shitty job of implementing this new approach, we can stonewall him until he gives up, then we can impose on the new guy to go back to the way it was always done. (And what's he gonna do, fire me?) These relationships can get very toxic, and it's a blind spot for the civilians in particular: in some ways it embodies the worst things people say about the public service. (Bureaucrats who stifle change, demand to have things done their own way, and lay down their tools at the merest suggestion of a new approach.)

It also means that sometimes the uniformed people end up doing jobs they aren't really qualified or interested in doing. Especially in technical or specialist settings, it's not unusual to find a team of subject-matter-expert civilians being supervised by a uniformed guy who doesn't have a clue what any of it means. In that situation, at best you get a Smiling Guy who doesn't really understand the work, but means well, and stays out of the way, and trusts his people to do a good job while he just stays in his office and signs the papers. (Or, rather, stamps the papers. I'll explain in a bit.); at worst, you get uniformed people who actively resent being made to do work they find frustrating or which they consider menial or beyond their ken. 

Finally, it can mean that civilians wind up being supervised by uniformed personnel who don't really know *how* to supervise civilians: people who've spent their whole careers ordering soldiers around, and suddenly they find themselves surrounded by office workers in hoodies and jeans who expect things like coffee breaks and sick leave and to be allowed to depart on time even if the job isn't done.

The truth of the matter, and something which gets drilled into new staff at orientation, is that service members sign up for an extremely challenging and demanding responsibility which transcends the difficulty or complexity of any individual task or role. The demands routinely made of service members are almost unthinkable to civilian employees: the example I kept hearing is that, if your Sergeant literally tells a uniformed member to throw themselves on a land mine, they're pretty much obligated to do it. Civilians, with our collective agreements and above-average working conditions, inhabit a completely different world.

It gets especially frustrating in situations where you, as a civilian, are in the minority within your workgroup -- especially if you do the same tasks as uniformed personnel. (Which is quite common in maintenance, motor pool and healthcare settings: you'll literally be working shoulder to shoulder with uniformed personnel, doing the exact same work.) From what I've heard, this can get especially bad in medical centres and dental clinics, particularly for women in clerical and administrative roles. Conversely, if you work in a more mixed environment, things tend to cut in the other direction altogether, where the uniformed people get treated like civilians. In my workplace, which was about 90% civilian, we actually had a reputation as the best place for uniformed people to work, simply because they were held to civilian standards and afforded certain civilian privileges by virtue of being surrounded by civilians.

I really do want to emphasize that it's not all toxic. My workplace was resoundingly healthy, by far the healthiest environment I'd ever worked in. Because, after all, that culture clash also has upsides if you manage it properly: the civilian with 24 years of experience can coach and mentor the newbie in a uniform; the young man in the uniform (strong and vigorous and in the prime of life) can take on different tasks from the old civilian fart who's two years from retirement; the guy in the uniform just posted in from CFB Esquimalt, where they do things completely differently, and talking that out with the civilian who's been working at Cold Lake since the Mulroney administration can be good for both of them; etc. etc. etc.",True,,1518258394.0,1518229594.0,,t3_7whjk2,t3_7whjk2,24,0,0

Perhaps you need to re-evaluate your work situation.  Is it the workload, the coworkers, the hours, etc? If you moved into another position, would it fix the problem, or would it be the same? Will a short stint away from the office (sick leave) rejuvenate you to continue when you return, or will it be resolved? Not to play devils advocate here, but I've witnessed too many coworkers and managers take stress leave in the past few years to the point of abusing the option. It's like a new public service fad, or entitlement to take time off. They come back and the work and stresses haven't changed, so a year or two later, they're off again for another few months.  What I'm getting at is the leave may not be the solution you're looking for or need.  Perhaps it could allow you to self reflect and decide the next steps on your path forward to personal health. I would suggest you flag anything thing that is unsustainable with your immediate manager or supervisor and try to work out a solution (i.e., working form home once a week, or a few hours in the morning, delegating some of your duties, hiring more staff to help take on the workload?).",True,,1518575426.0,1518546626.0,,t3_7wegvc,t3_7wegvc,1,0,0

**Work description** - this should be a reasonably-accurate reflection of the work you currently do. It should have at least been updated by management and reviewed by HR within the past five years or so. If yours is out of date you can ask your manager to take a look at it and update if needed.

**Job classification** - this is done based on the work description, using a set of standards for each classification (the standards available here: http://acoc-acco.ca/tbs-classification-standards). Reclassifying a job to an entirely different category is pretty unusual unless the work description has significantly changed.

**Education requirements** - the minimums for each classification are set by Treasury Board as part of the Qualification Standards.

There are two kind of women staffers in the cabinets  ""the wives/girlfriends/daughters"" of important campaign contributers/party workers  and everyone else.  Obviously no one acts in an innapropriate way with the 1st group since they are someone's protégé.   As for the 2nd beleive me some of these girls are ready to do anything to get the job or get promoted.  And yes, if they can,  they do capitalize on their looks to get ahead.  There are a lot of girls with communication degrees and not enough well paid jobs....

(P.S.  It's the same with men, some are protected by their family connections, some are more expandable. The 2nd ones are not hit on by male colleagues  but generally have to work more for less money...)

What's trully ""wonderful"" with cabinets is that ""anyone"" can have ""any role""  and the salary is to the discression of the elected official (and pressure he gets from the party/PMO/someone who vouches for the candidate).   Remember a staffer can be paid from 0$ up to AS-8....

Hiring procedures are extremely informal,   HR departement is inexistant,  and you can be dismessed/promoted for right or wrong reasons.

Abuse  towards staff (from superiors) and between colleagues is rampant and everyone is pretty much for themsleves, despite the offical display party loyalty.   If you think your office politics are bad,  cabinet is 10 times worse.  If you ask any staffer about this, they'll obviously deny that toxic atmosphere exists.

The woman in the article knew and knows all of this, she worked in politics before,  she knows a lot of lobbyists and staffers in the provincial and federal goverment, not knowing who Gagné is when you're from the Quebec liberals is impossible. 

So in short, she was ready to put up with the innapropriate remarks as long as she would get the job.  
But she didn't, so we get to read her rant about ""the toxic culture"" which she endures and keeps enduring by the way while working for a provincial MP.

As for having bikini shots on your public profile, well if you don't want to get comments from random people , don't make those photos public. Don't want to have comments on your physique - don't show off your physique to unknown people.  
Don't want to have unknown men hitting on you ,  don't put "" relationship status : ""single"" on facebook. 

In fact it's better not to have your real and full name on facebook if you work aspire to work with the public.

As for Gagné, he always tried to hit on girls during political events (hell in fb profile is him surrounded by liberal staffers),  I guess the other guy also tried to get some using his poistion as a staffer.  No it's not professional in anyway, and i hope this situation is a lesson for everyone who works or aspires to work in poltics.  No I don't think you should lose your job if you messaged someone on fb to compliment her on her body, and no that doesn't qualify as sexual agression, maybe Gagné did other things, but then why did his superiors looked the other way.  Ultimately it's not the 1st time someone mirrors a job opportunity with hopes of getting laid, social media (FB/Linkedin) just helps documenting it.

    Very Ineffective - will make the situation worse
    Ineffective - while it may not worsen the situation, it will not contribute to solving the problem
    Somewhat Ineffective - may not contribute to solving the problem
    Somewhat Effective - may contribute to solving the problem
    Effective - will contribute to solving the problem
    Very Effective - will solve the problem or make a very important contribution to solving the problem

Your answers will need to be on the ""effectiveness"" level, but I found it much easier to think about responses using the *description* rather than the *label*.

I think the public service is overall a good place to be in terms of resolving most difficult work-place scenarios, but suffers when it comes to ""official"" complaints over unhealthy work environment, with complainants being seen as ""whiners"" or not ""team players."" Just look at the recent report issued by the Public Service Integrity Commissioner about an incident with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and a troublesome executive -
completely swept under the rug. 

I think if you have grounds for harassment, I say by all means submit a complaint once you've exhausted all your options of addressing this informally (i.e directly engaging the senior execs in question). Although I'm sure that you need concrete evidence for doing so; filing complaints about the *suspicion* of being harassed might not pass the rigor required to be considered a bona fide complaint. For example, you're finding that things are being said over e-mail, keep EVERYTHING! This also includes keeping emails you may send trying to be proactive and resolving the conflict. Having said this, I would strongly recommend simply leaving your team and look religiously for other opportuities - apply for internal postings, look for deployment opportunities on GCConnex, or network outside your dept. 

I was a term in my old department with a director that would consistently berate me and my team members, and overall created a very unhealthy and demoralizing work environment. I, along with many other team members, found that the easiest solution to our situation was simply getting out and moving teams or departments.

You should do what you ultimately think is right but as a term myself, I would not file an official complaint or go to the union. I have heard of differential treatment by unions of term employees vs indeterminate employees. Nominally, they’re supposed to have your back just as much as they do indeterminate employees but they actively complain about departments using term employees to fill boxes that should otherwise go to indeterminate employees and I’ve heard very different things about how term employees are treated by unions vs indeterminate employees. Tread carefully if you do decide to proceed and don’t assume anyone is on your side. I know that’s cynical but the system is fucked and you need to watch out for yourself above all else.

If it were me, I would do everything I can to move to a different team as soon as possible. Deploying to another division or department at-level would be the fastest way to accomplish this. Use GCConnex, reach out to previous supervisors, ask friends, coldcall, etc. If it’s as uncomfortable as you say, you should want out of there as soon as you can. If you do decide to proceed with a formal complaint, I actually think you’d be able to do it better from a place of safety in a division that does not involve your toxic boss and at a pace and in a manner that you decide rather than doing it with the pressure of working alongside someone you’re actively lodging an official complaint against.

As far as how my team works, we require 50% of the team to be bilingual with BBB. I am completely English, I can pick up words here and there but I can't carry a conversation in French. I work in an operational environment for RCMP so there wasn't substantial French but there were enough reports where French was needed half the time.

I suggest separating in your mind the information that's in Peoplesoft, and what you are actually entitled to for leave credits. Your leave entitlements are available to you *no matter what is listed in Peoplesoft*. Start tracking them yourself, using an Excel spreadsheet or on paper. Start with the balances from your previous department, and then add vacation leave on a month-by-month basis based on what you'd be entitled under your collective agreement (adjusting upward for the month in which your 8th anniversary of service occurs). Treat this as a 'shadow' tracking system and ignore what's in Peoplesoft for now. 

Show the spreadsheet to your manager, and use that to determine what you have available on a month-to-month basis. As you take vacation leave, deduct from your shadow spreadsheet. 

From now until the Pay Centre gets to your request, use the 'shadow' system to track your leave credits and debits. It's a pain in the butt, but it'll give you what you (and your manager) need to ensure that the Peoplesoft system is updated correctly whenever Pay Centre gets to your request.

Apart from the fact that it generally doesn't work, it just clutters up the whole system: a unit with some other purpose (a union president's office, a constituency office, a minister's office, etc.) gets turned into a receiving centre for mountains of paperwork; in the unlikely event that New Brunswick even cares, employees at that end need to be pulled away from the actual work of resolving cases in order to be briefed on this request; other people already in the queue get their requests delayed because someone called the minister about her acting pay; all along the line, it just disrupts things and slows them down to no real end apart from giving people the specious notion that Something Is Being Done.

First. I'd double check what you applied for, as I am about 95% sure it's not for a *permanent* position as a Telephone Interviewer. Indeterminate exists, but not for new hires.

Second, you *can* apply for internal jobs once you're hired. You'll be hired under the Statistics Act, yes, and you don't actually have a ""real"" classification, but you're still eligible to apply and get internal jobs.

Upward movement... Yeah, it's not great. You can become a supervisor relatively easy depending on openings, and then from there a spot in management is possible, but not too likely. In a couple years when next census starts up, then openings are likely (or you'll have a good shot to go to census maybe), but otherwise it's unlikely. The number of managers is unlikely to go up, so unless one of them leaves, a spot won't be opening.

Work environment is what you make of it. I don't know which office you mean when you say West (there are two) so I couldn't comment directly. The work itself is pretty easy if you're an outgoing person and won't take what some members of the public say to heart. You'll get yelled at and sworn at on the phone - that's inevitable, but honestly, it depends on you and how that affects you. You'll also get to talk to a lot of really interesting people and if you care about your work, it can be meaningful.

Hours can vary enormously. Are you bilingual? You'll almost be guaranteed work if you are. If not, depends what that office is hiring for. You could work full time for two weeks, then have nothing for a month. You could work ten days out of a month and that's it. Or it could be almost full time for months...then back to one week a month.

As I said before, you *can* get indeterminate, but it's not simple. The ""after three years automatically"" does not apply. The only possibility is when an indeterminate process is run, and then there are usually qualifications. One of those usually being worked there for x-yeara.

1. Have an open-door policy for all the employees. My former director was very uh.... formal and you could only meet after meeting with your immediate supervisor in regards to concerns and goals. Plus the director would ask why you are meeting and if you spoke with your manager about the concerns. Unless you were a higher level, you could not just talk with the director casually; you had to ""follow your channel"" It made the director intimidating and uninterested in your concerns. So I would suggest you make sure all the employees can just walk into your office to discuss concerns(when you are not busy of course!)

2. Invest in your employees! My old director would rather deploy random analysts into the team instead of investing in those who were already there. It made those employees unhappy and their work performance suffered cause they did not feel valued. Provide acting opportunities and promote those who did their competitions successfully in order to retain experience and talent!

3. Be honest with your employees and treat them like people. I am sorry if this sounds obvious but my experience with other directors were not so great. When I asked for opportunities they would make lies up and excuses and it made me feel like garbage.. If you can't provide an opportunity to an employee tell that person why and that you would love to when the chance comes up. I can tell you if I heard that my morale would be so high!

* My first piece of advice is delegate and get comfortable doing so! You will get flooded with HR tasks, financial tasks, random emergencies and whatever your DG may be delegating to you. You will not have enough hours in a week to get through it all. Things run so smoothly when tasks that can/should be delegated to managers, are! I know sometimes my director feels bad delegating, whether it be because she feels like she's overworking the managers or feels as if she's being lazy for not doing it herself, but the reality is she's just as overworked and there has to be a balance. 

* Establish a good relationship with your EA (I hope you have a good one!). This may be a little biased, but I have an exceptional relationship with my director and that has caused me to having an exceptional relationship with the managers as well. This means that often, I am able to get the managers or even team leaders on tasks even before the director even sees it, which again, frees up time for your more pressing tasks. Find out what works for you, what you would like, schedule a weekly bilat with your EA if necessary. A few pointers that help us run smoothly here are:

1. having a printout of the daily calendar in the AM

2. having a in box for signatures, and an out box so that your EA can just go distribute them once they are signed

3. having a ""knock policy"" which means I go an knock 5 minutes before a meeting is supposed to end so that meetings don't run long and mess up the agenda for the day (obviously not when it's a high-level meeting)

4. if you are visual, get important emails printed for you, if not, have some categories on outlook so that your EA can mark more pressing emails for you to look at them (i.e ""for action"", ""for review"" etc.)  






* Have monthly, or biweekly if possible, team meetings. This (to me at least) shows the team you care and you are making time to hear them out. Have your agenda with your items and then allow enough time for a round table for the whole team to have a chance to speak.

* This was mentioned already but open door policy is a big one. The last thing you want is people being scared of coming to you with any concerns or problems.

* This was also mentioned, but investing in your team is huge. We have a developmental program here that has been working great and it creates incentive for our team to work even harder, and towards a goal. 

* This may seem small but, when you have a new hire, no matter the level, do the walk around and introduce them. Even if you did not hire them directly, it sets the tone for that person and they will know feel more comfortable approaching you. 

* Have a good social committee and be involved with them! My director stays in the loop and suggests ideas every so often for activities and team building. It makes a big difference and she never misses an activity which, again, shows the team you care. 

* Block yourself 30 minutes a day if you can to do any pressing HR/Finance/Signatures/Email cleanup. It helps tremendously!

* Something that helps have a smooth running day here without having to book a ton of small meetings is having a ""daily"" : 15 to 30 minutes either every day or 2-3 times a week to talk to the managers first thing in the morning so that everyone is on the same page.

* EAT LUNCH! Block that time in your calendar!

* One of the biggest things that I noticed keeps the team happy is acknowledgement. Whether it be an email or in passing, receiving praise for good work on a big issue or just in general is very much appreciated by everyone.

* Set a daily calendar reminder 30 minutes before you should leave the office. Don't overwork yourself! You stay happy, and it's highly likely you'll be able to keep your team happy :)

Honestly, being here, you're probably at the top range of executives already so I wouldn't be too concerned. I'd be quite happy to have a director receptive enough and interested enough to be here on reddit asking for advice.

That being said, I can give some advice: Don't let yourself burn out. Don't let yourself become a boring dull director who does not care. Who walls themselves off from their employees. Who becomes an ineffective leader who just pushes for higher performance because that's what their DG wants. 

Be a leader and remain interested. Talk to your staff at lower levels so they know who you are and what you're all about and so you can get to know who they are and what they're about. Use your staff effectively and don't push them to burn out. Make them happy to come to work each day because they're working on things that interest them that also help achieve the goals of the division.

I just left a job with the best director I have had to date. From the moment he walked in the door, I knew it was going to be good. I was on my way out the door. I had lined up an at-level secondment with a category change to get me going down a different path, but not necessarily the one I wanted. I stayed put because I could tell I could learn a lot from him. 

Some of the things he did/does: 

1) Take an interest in your colleagues and your team. Their wants, their aspirations. I'd been stuck in a role that I wasn't jazzed about for a variety of reasons. The second day he was there he told me ""I am sure you are competent, but you don't belong here. My goal is to get you to where you want to go on your path."" He came in June, and by November, I switched categories and am in a job two levels higher. 

2) Allow them opportunities to spread their wings. This doesn't have to mean expensive training, this could just mean, ""Hey. Do you want to try your hand at this task?"" or ""Do you want to sit in on this meeting to get more contextual information?"" Within reason, of course, but what he pulled me into was always super interesting, and he took the time to debrief with me afterwards. 

3) Lead by example. He really walked the walk and talked the talk. He was super concerned about making sure everything was on the up and up, and ""doing the right thing"", but also to create and promote a good work/life balance by enabling us to take time during the week to attend to health. (We were co-located with DND, so that was something they had and he provided it to us too, while attending to his own stuff.)

I was in a very similar situation as you about a year ago. My academic background is in political science. I had previous experiences working in parliament, NGOs/non-profits, and with academic research, all at the assistant/intern level. My first job in government was a casual PM-01 contract but I always knew from the beginning that I was overqualified for the PM-01 and that I wanted a policy job. It took me about a year after being hired into the government to get my current position as a policy advisor (EC-04).

I think it's great that you got a job in the federal government. Honestly, any government job helps to get your foot in the door first because it will allow you time to gain the prerequisites you need to get the policy job you want. 

First, you should aim to get BBB in your second language assessments. Many policy jobs require BBB and if you want to keep moving up, you'll want to eventually get CBC or CCC (depending on how high you want to go/what department you want to work at) but BBB is a good start. Ask your immediate supervisor if they can put you through for second language testing. If your immediate supervisor says no, find another way. Apply for any jobs that you can that require BBB even if you don't want the job because if they'll put you through for the language tests, you can use those results for any future jobs you would want. 

Second, get your secret clearance. Again, this is not essential for all policy jobs in all departments but it opens more doors, especially for departments like defense, public safety, RCMP, CBSA, immigration, global affairs, etc. where secret clearance is most likely required. Again, ask your supervisor if they're willing to put you through for secret clearance. If they say no, do the same as above and apply for any jobs that require secret clearance so they'll put you through for the clearance if they're seriously considering your candidacy. 

Third, cold-call anyone you might want to work for or who might put you through for language testing and/or secret clearance. You already have policy experience, even if it's not in government. That's valuable. The division that initially hired me as a PM-01 didn't want to put me through for language testing or secret clearance. So I cold-called/emailed every Assistant Director/Deputy Director (don't email Directors, they have very little to do with making hiring decisions) of the various divisions in my branch asking if they were looking for a PM-03 or equivalent employee (I know it sounds crazy but I figured I had nothing to lose) and wrote a bullet-point summary of my qualifications with specific reasons of why I wanted to work for their division. I also tailored my resume to suit what I thought they would want to see in a prospective candidate. I used the department Intranet to look up descriptions of each division as well as the department's organizational chart so that I can better tailor my brief cover letter in my cold-calls/emails. I also cold-called divisions in other departments doing similar work. Most ignored me. Some were kind and said they'd pass my resume along or they had informal meetings with me giving me advice or trying to see if there could be a fit in their team. One asked me if I'd be interested in a PM-02 position and asked if I had my BBB and secret clearance. I said no but they put me through for language testing and secret clearance anyway because they were interested in hiring me. The process of language testing and secret clearance took 2-3 months to complete. In the end, I decided I didn't want to work for that division but I had my BBB and my secret clearance in hand, which was the most important part of this process. You don't need everyone to be clamoring to hire you. Most will ignore you. You just need ONE to put you through for language testing and secret clearance and you're golden. 

After I got my BBB and my secret clearance, I did another round of cold-calling/emailing with the customized resumes/brief cover letters. Again, most ignored me. Some were kind. I had a couple of interviews with others. One was looking for an EC-04 Policy Advisor right away and asked me to come in for an interview as they happened to be interviewing candidates that week. I did really well at the interview. They asked for my references. My references were both extremely positive. I got hired a few weeks later. I think I also had a competitive edge as the job required BBB and secret clearance and they needed someone to start RIGHT AWAY. I already had it so they didn't have to wait for any of that to come through. I was a term employee at my home division at this point. This new job was at a different department and they did a non-advertised process to hire me at the higher level.

Don't let people convince you that you should wait your turn and spend hours applying for advertised processes and hope to get selected into a pool and then eventually hired a year later when they decide to pull you out because it's the only ""right"" way to do things. Don't let people convince you that you should only aim for ""reasonable"" jumps like a level or two above. That's just ONE way to get the job you want in the public service. There are always other ways. There's always a side door, a side window, a garage, etc. Be relentless (but always polite and gracious as well) and don't be afraid to ask for what you really want. Like I said, most people will ignore you. But that's okay. Success is hard-work, talent/skill, and opportunity/luck. You have the talent/skill (based on your previous experiences), you can put in the hard work to do the networking/cold-calling/outreach that you need to do, and you just need to meet the right opportunity. If you keep trying and you keep asking, you will. But you'll never get there if you don't try and if you don't make the ask.

And don't worry about having started at your job so soon. All of the things I described above take TIME. Get started now as this process will take time to bear fruit. You can still put the job description of your current position on your resume. It is your job, right? And by the time you get your BBB, your secret clearance, and hear back from the people you've cold-called, you'll have been doing that job for a few months.

Be passionate about a subject (preferably work-related), and learn all the specialized vocabulary related to it, and practice forming grammatically-sound sentences to describe it.

This allowed me to demonstrate a high level of competency in my second language, since I already know how to express myself properly with precise industry-specific vocabulary.

Cash-outs, however, require separate accounting within managers' budgets, so instead they're more likely to order you to take vacation time.  That's within their rights (most/all agreements also allow the employer to schedule vacation time), but probably not what you want.

Similarly, personal day(s) do not roll-over and can be used for any purpose you want, no reason required, subject to advance notice and operational requirements.

It's possible, but you should **never, ever, ever, ever, EVER** enter into a temporary situation with the assumption you'll be seamlessly or easily converted into a permanent position, or even that your position will be extended. Even if your manager promises. Even if everyone really likes you. Even if you're good at your job. Even if other people in similar positions are getting converted.

You never know when your manager will get hit by a bus (in which case his replacement may not honour his promises), or your team gets torn up and split into different divisions, or your project goes into sunset, or someone royally screws up at Public Works or finance and your position disappears into a bureaucratic black hole, or the FTEs just aren't there, or the whole function gets relocated to Glace Bay, or someone at headquarters carves just enough money out of your division's budget to slide you out of your position -- and even if the wheels are turning and the stars have aligned and they're rolling you a position as we speak, there are still dozens and dozens of things which could go wrong. (For no apparent reason, HR insists on a higher language rating than you could possibly attain. Someone with priority drops out of the sky and steals your newly-created box. Someone comes back from leave unexpectedly and HR holds a gun to your manager's head, bumping you out of ""your"" box. The non-advertised appointment gets rejected somewhere along the line. HR insists that the job have an essential educational credential which you don't possess. The budget just doesn't materialize...)

It's possible, yes.

Do not count on it happening. It almost certainly won't.

From 2015 to 2016, the EX population increased by 0.85%, from 6,360 to 6,414.  Then add in the 1.25% increase that the unionized employees received and you reach roughly 2.1% accounting for both population growth and inflation.

3.2% [total spending increase] - 2.1% [population growth and inflationary increase]= 0.85%

So now we're only looking at a 0.85% increase in executive bonuses compared to the unionized employees. This increase might be explained by the fact that they may have had limited increases in previous years due to austerity measures, and EXs doing bonus-worthy work to start up new programs and adjust to the change in government.

I scored 5/5 on each of the competencies (a perfect score) so I guess I did the assessment the way that they wanted me to.  

My tips: 

* The assessment is *long*. The time allotted is 3.25 hours, and when I wrote it I needed every minute of it. You will be doing a LOT of writing, and when I did it it was entirely using pen-and-paper (my hand is cramping up just recalling the experience). 

* [Read the test description](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/services/staffing-assessment-tools-resources/human-resources-specialists-hiring-managers/human-resources-toolbox/personnel-psychology-centre/consultation-test-services/public-service-commission-tests/middle-manager-basket-exercise-820.html). Then read it again and again. Memorize the definitions used for the competencies, because that's what you have to demonstrate. 

* The entire assessment was done *in writing*. Basically I sat down in a room, was given the test package, and I spent the next three hours reading and writing. If you are a slow reader or can't keep multiple items organized in your head, you will have difficulty. I kept some scrap paper nearby to jot down notes on all of the materials. By the end, I had things written everywhere - some on the items that they gave me as part of the package, some on separate sheets of paper, but almost everything had some kind of note on it. 

* Treat the exercise as if you were a manager working in 1960, and computers haven't entered the workplace. Everything is communicated by written memos, and every decision you make has to be done *in writing*. For each item you deal with, there should be a paper trail.

* Delegating is one of the competencies that you are being assessed on. That means that you don't need to take direct action on every item. You can (and should) delegate items to your assistant, other employees, etc. If you delegate, *following up* is part of the competency. This could be as simple as ""Please set up a meeting with Bob within the next week, and send me a note once you've done that. I will follow up with you on Friday if I haven't heard from you by then"". 

* For ""planning"" and ""organizing"", you'll note that the competencies require you to be ""orderly"" and ""systematic"". That means you should have a good system in place for your calendar, your to-dos, and your plans for upcoming work. 

* For ""managing programs"", you will need to take steps to ensure the work is done *accurately* and that *policies are followed*. Give some thought to how you might express that in writing and what systems you might put in place to ensure quality/compliant work.

The group held regular meetings and included participants from various parts of Canada via videoconference.

When connecting to the boardroom in one region, the in-person NCR participants were given an unpleasant surprise when they became witness to two individuals.....getting busy. The conference was (luckily) muted but in-person meeting participants could see everything. The meeting organizer attempted to alert the individuals, in vain.

His management style was from the parking lot of the bar when he had to take a conference call....Heard more recently it's now his garage.


True Story : Worked where the expected work was 5 items a day - it honestly took up maybe 2hrs of your day at most (Seriously kid you not). If you did that, you met the quota. One employee would maybe do 1 or 2 if that and then complain about being over worked. ",True,,1516064315.0,1516035515.0,,t3_7qbw6m,t3_7qbw6m,3,0,0

1. Harassing a specific individual. (Pursuing them romantically or sexually after they've said this attention is unwelcome. Invading their privacy. Invading their personal space after being told to back off. etc.)
2. Consistently failing to read the room, and thereby maintaining an inappropriate tone for the workplace. (Routinely making sexist jokes. Displaying pictures or art which crosses the line. Taking ""jokes"" too far, or making ""jokes"" about inappropriate subjects: ""Yeah, but she's a woman, and we're hiring an engineer, so do we really *need* to interview her?"")
3. Treating women differently from men, in a manner which makes the women uncomfortable, subjects them to stereotypical or unfair treatment, or unduly draws attention to differences. (Calling all the women ""darling"" and ""kitten"" in contexts where the men get called by their names. Treating female subordinates differently from male subordinates.

This is *exactly* the reason that staffing advisors exist in government, because most managers don’t staff positions on a regular basis. 

In your example, the manager could choose to pursue the deployment and deploy the individual into a vacant position, and still continue with the advertised process to create a pool for other vacancies. Deployments are *lateral transfers* so the person being deployed is already at the same or an equivalent position. Whether that’s an advisable option would depend on the person being deployed, the reason the person wants the deployment, the qualifications of that person, the potential fit of the deployed person into the team, the composition of the candidate pool for the advertised process, and any number of other variables.

>Persons appointed to the core public administration who request leave to serve in Reserve Forces activities...

Such leave is to conform to the provisions of the Reserve Forces Training Leave Regulations made pursuant to the National Defence Act.

>Persons on leave without pay for this purpose may only be replaced on a term basis and are to be reinstated in the position that they occupied on the day before the day on which the leave began. If the person with the delegated authority is not able to reinstate the person in that position by reason of a workforce adjustment, the workforce adjustment measures apply.

>As the type of leave, reason for the leave and duration of the leave will vary for each reservist; managers with delegated authority must obtain, from the employee, appropriate National Defence documentation when approving the leave request. Furthermore, before proceeding on a leave of absence to participate in Reserve Forces activities, employees should be directed to both the National Defence and departmental Compensation organizations to seek confirmation of the impact that the leave with or without pay will have on their pay, pension, insurances and collective agreement provisions.

After the announcement of the [New Direction in Staffing](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/services/appointment-framework/video-new-direction-staffing.html) in April 2016, departments were expressly told that there is no longer a ""preference"" for advertised processes over non-advertised ones, so non-advertised processes became more frequent, mostly because they were almost unheard of for the decade prior. 

Each Deputy Head has to establish criteria where non-advertised processes can be used - if you want to know those criteria, they should be available on your departmental intranet.

Pools can be undesirable for many reasons. Managers may disagree with the process used to create pools, either excluding qualified candidates or including underqualifed ones (or worst both). Pools may be old and no suitable fits found within a pool. I see as many processes still run from scratch as using pools. Generally, I see pools used when all the hiring is happening at once and the majority of the hiring groups contribute to pool assessment.

Because of the extreme timeframes now for any advertised process, going on 18 months+, those are being seen as a very last choice anyway. Other mechanisms, particularly bridging are much more commonly being used instead.

EDIT: The only candidate that must be considered in any selection process are the priority list folks. They must be excluded first before any offer can be made.

(Disclaimer: The below applies to GAC FS positions. IRCC has a somewhat similar but different process for their FS processes).

The external FS competition that runs some, but not all, years as part of the Post-Secondary Recruitment campaign in the Fall is literally, by number of applicants to positions available, the MOST competitive regular competition for a Government of Canada job. As in thousands of people apply for what may only be 10 to 20 positions (maybe less).

Bare minimums for background include a CCC second language profile (so quite fluently bilingual) and some form of post-secondary degree. They often throw in several asset criteria as well which can include graduate degrees, specific degrees, various types of work experience and durations etc.

You need to complete the application with all of the above.

You need to write and do reasonably well on the Public Service Entrance Exam.

Even if you do the above, they sometimes use random selection to ween down the number of candidates to a manageable level so your process may end here, at no fault of your own.

You need to write and do fairly well on the Intercultural Adaptation Assessment.

You need to do at least an individual, if not also a group, interview and do quite well on that.

You need to do the Second Language Evaluations for Reading, for Writing, and for Oral and get C or E in them all (unless you have valid scores already).

You need your references to check out.

You need to get your Top Secret (Level III) clearance.

Once all that is done, you can be appointed. But that is a lot to do, it often takes well over a year to all happen, and GAC's HR are renowned for just screwing it up and processes going no where. But the next chance to apply will be October 2018, maybe (they may not run the competition in 2018, they didn't in 2017). I think I recall the average age of people appointed to FS jobs being in the 30s.

As for non-FS classifications that work abroad, generally those people have jobs in Canada and take the postings abroad for a specific duration. They can work for departments that are not GAC as well, depending on the issue. There are not really many non-locally engaged staff postings abroad for non-FS employees.

The system which was initially put in place to be fair and transparent has become too inflexible for the modern day workplace - yes, even within bureaucracies. Based on current practices, managers and directors can only justify hiring someone based on what is presented within the scope of the formal competition and formal reference checks. 

For example, the reference request is usually for your immediate supervisor and manager *only*. Yet, your manager and supervisor only see you for a few minutes a week and have limited insight into your personality and day-to-day work. There seems to be no flexibility to present other more useful references: clients, project teams, and other stakeholders who interact and engage with you on a daily basis. Furthermore, if your manager and/or supervisors see you as a workhorse and don't want to let you go, will they have enough integrity and maturity to provide a good reference? 

Individuals who end up filing grievances or are left feeling confused as to why they weren't chosen, despite stellar references, is largely due to these outside conversations. It would almost be better to adopt private sector practices of hiring and promotions; this way employees don't suffer from cognitive dissonance and the illusion that everything is fair and transparent.

Some stats on new executives (2017 numbers) that should help answer your question: 

* Roughly 500 or so executives were appointed (consistent for last few years)
* less than 30% are under the age of 40. Most (50%) are between 40-49. 
* 83% have more than 10 years of experience in the federal public service. 
* 33% came from the EC classification, with AS (10%) and PM (8%) a distant second and third.
* Fewer moves appear to be better. 27% of new executives have only worked in one department. 25% worked in two, and 23% worked in 3. Lots of moves brought down chances. only 13% had worked in 4 departments and 5 or more departments was 11%.
* There is gender parity, 52% of new executives are female.
* 93% have a bachelors degree and 53% have a masters.

It's also worth noting the [2015 Demographic Profile of Executives](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/human-resources-statistics/demographic-snapshot-federal-public-service-2015.html#fig13). Only 0.8% of federal government executives are under the age of 34. That means there are about 50 of us. 

So based on the stats, the profile of a candidate most likely to become an executive is:

* At least 40 years old
* Has a university education
* Has worked in the public service at least 10 years (but more likely 15-20)
* Has worked in 3 departments or less
* Works in the EC classification

I've just started applying for EX 01 posters, I'm 35,and have 16yrs experience. I just didn't want to do management until I got thrust into it, and turns out I like it (go figure). I'm hoping to land an EX 01 in the next couple years, but no huge rush.

If you want to move up the ranks, show initiative, but don't overreach all the time. Don't tell managers what they should do, but drop good ideas in their laps and learn from mistakes (yours and theirs). Don't be a kiss ass either :p

There are a lot of good csps courses you can take, all are free. Don't overstep and ask for managers dev program, or aspiring directors (which is restricted to TMP and ex min 1), but take training to learn best practices and procedures, from csps, and remain critical of those ideas as you develop your own methods of doing shit.

Also, find a mentor. I've recently asked a DG from another dept to mentor me, and she's agreed. I've worked in proximity of her for 4 years, and she's your model EX/human, so I'm happy to have snagged her. I'm hoping to learn how to manage my work and employees better, learning from her travels.

JANUARY 5, 2018

 

Overpayments and tax season
 

As we enter the 2017 tax filing season, the registration of overpayments in Phoenix will be critical to ensuring employees avoid tax issues and maintain their eligibility for important social benefits. If you were overpaid and did not receive a letter from the Pay Centre, you must call the Contact Centre at 1-855-686-4729 by January 19, 2018. This will ensure that your overpayment is registered in Phoenix.

The Pay Centre is working hard to process registered overpayments by the end of January 2018. This will ensure that T4 and Relevé 1 slips will reflect the correct salary of employees. This will also mean that those with an overpayment will only be required to repay the net amount received. The Pay Centre will confirm this information in writing once the overpayment is processed.

The Pay Centre will work with you to confirm a flexible repayment plan that best suits your needs. If your overpayment is not registered by January 31, 2018, you will have to repay the gross amount. However, you will not need to make any repayments until July 2018, after your tax account has been credited with an amount equal to the difference between the net and gross overpayment. This will ensure that no one is out of pocket as a result of an overpayment.

Finally, we would like to remind you that it is important that you file your 2017 tax return before the April 30, 2018, deadline to maintain your eligibility for certain benefits and credits.

If you want to learn more about overpayments and tax filing season, we invite you to consult these new dedicated web pages.

Thank you for your patience,

1. Even ""winning"" doesn't necessarily guarantee you a promotion. If you can show that someone else was promoted *unfairly* and that you should have been promoted instead, you might be able to bump them out -- but if you just illustrate broad bias in need of correction but without showing that any individual process was so egregiously biased as to merit undoing, you might not get anything material to show for it.
2. You're almost certainly gonna piss people off no matter how you pursue it. Some people will resent you ""fiddling"" with ""their"" decisions. Some will view you as a threat. (You are, after all, trying to bump others out of their ""rightful"" promotions...) And insofar as you'd be walking into any promotion with ""EQUITY HIRE"" stamped on your forehead, there are workplaces where people would resent you for it. (They shouldn't. It's dumb. It's racist. But it happens.)
3. Racial and gender bias in hiring and promotion often reflect broader attitudes and biases. If this is the case in your workplace, then getting ahead -- particularly if you do it by ""making a fuss"" and ""creating problems"" for the people in charge -- may actually put you in a more vulnerable situation. The broader environment in your workgroup won't necessarily improve just because you fix one staffing process: often people feel chastened and ashamed, but instead of turning to introspection and thinking about their role in the situation, prefer to blame the complainant for ""stirring up drama"" and ""playing the [race/gender] card"". It's disgusting, but it happens.

None of this means that you shouldn't pull the trigger. If you were wrongly denied a promotion because your bosses are biased and making poor decisions as a result, then you should absolutely talk to the union and document stuff and start working up a grievance. Even if you don't necessarily get your rightful promotion, you're reminding your boss that they can't treat people this way, that the bulk of the bureaucracy is on your side, and that -- regardless of their own biases and feelings -- they need to follow the rules. That's all worth doing.

But there's a fuller picture here than you pulling that trigger and getting a promotion three months later. You might not get it. You might find you don't like it. You might get drummed out by a boss who now resents you even more. And you might be happier and better off looking for an exit to a workgroup where the people treat you right.

""is it true that managers have this huge fear of being accused of racism""

this is actually a broader issue in the Western world. People are being accused of being racists, homophobic, sexist, etc., when in reality they simply do not abide with the extremists views on some topics (from the left-wing ultra feminists to the gun lovers religious right). This has lead to an extreme level of political correctness that is now the Achilles heel of the Western civilization and is being abused by countries like Russia (see what they did with the US election by organizing demonstration as fake left-wing and right-wing groups to create trouble).

So back to your topic. I truly doubt anyone would give you a promotion based on a complaint that only white men are being promoted. First, you need to win a competition for the promotion and the hiring manager has to demonstrate how the person being promoted is the best fit. Of course, this isn't foolproof, if they have great writing skills and the HR person is lazy, anything goes... Now going around telling people your boss is a racist without evidence would most likely guarantee you would never get promoted, as you would not have good references and these are usually the key for the best-fit documents. So if you think you've been cheated in the past, take a look at your previous references, sometimes it wasn't necessarily bad and wasn't enough to disqualify you from a process, but something that was mentioned during the conversation may influence a hiring manager to go with someone else.

Or maybe every time you applied to a competition you were good, but there were better candidates out there. In those cases, ask for debriefs and work on what you get. If the debrief is useless, ask for more information and mention that the intent is not to fight their decision, but know what to improve.

There may still be a bias against you, I don't know which ethnic origin you are and if you wear visible religious gear, but these could be perceived negatively in an environment where most people are educated and being religious in general is somewhat seen as a sign of poor judgement and potential trouble (e.g. some groups that have clearly abused the religious discrimination and reasonable accommodation protection in the Constitution).

I worked for almost 5 years at GAC back when it was still called DFAIT and then DFATD. I worked with Trade Commissioners, Geographics (Politics), Consular Affairs, and Information / Web services.  All through temp help agencies, one FSWEP/coop, a casual, a term, and as a contractor (where I would bill my hours myself to the department). 

Although I really liked my experiences overall and met some wonderful people, and I'm thankful for the work experience it provided me, at times I also experienced a toxic workplace there, and some people actively contributing to that toxic environment. I mean people lying to each other and spreading rumors behind your back to improve their chances at being bridged (or lowering yours), to improve their standing in competitions for acting positions (or to harm yours), people intentionally withholding information from other divisions within the department to make their division look good and the other one less competent, divisions claiming their will cooperate with yours and then not, and so on.... Things you'd expect to see in a high school setting, but happening at a professional level.  I don't want to get into specifics, but yeah, I've seen it happen over & over again. 

This kind of thing happens in every work environment, but having worked for several other departments (Including Employment and Social Development Canada, Service Canada, and Innovation, Science and Economic Development), I can objectively say that it's particularly worse at GAC. Perhaps because people there are much more competitive when it comes to career advancement than in other departments? I'm not sure. But it came to a point where I didn't feel like applying to GAC's postsecondary recruitment process anymore. 

It's a shame because there are wonderful people working at Global Affairs who truly love what they do, and the work experience opportunities there can be amazing, but more than a few bad apples are spoiling it department-wide from what I experienced. 

Edit : I also noticed that some divisions operated as what I'd call student farms. Basically, 2/3 of the team are students on a 4-month co-op contract. They all hope in vain they will get renewed. At the end of the 4 months, another set of students get hired. And the cycle continues for years. Things may have changed since the many years I've been there, but what I'm saying is... just because you get in as a student, don't get your hopes too high.

Now, having been in the PS a few years and also some observations from talking to people and watching some careers, I have some GAC opinions.

1. They are currently quite the shitshow for HR and personnel management. Budget concerns make them very unwilling to commit to indeterminate jobs. That works for them because it seems like there is an endless supply of FSWEP/CO-OP/Casual and some terms to work there (see attitude above).

2. The department has its own culture (so do others), but it is also quite incestuous. People who get into GAC indeterminately rarely leave compared to movement out in other departments. This works against GAC. Their employees, at least in policy type work, get less diverse experiences and knowledge than say an EC who has been around a bit and maybe in a central agency or two.

3. GAC, perhaps by nature of the international studies and development programs attracting certain kinds of people, seems to be pretty partisan compared to the PS at large. Remember video of them all cheering in the lobby of HQ when Dion and co first came in as if they were being liberated from occupation? Most public servants in other departments have a semblance of control, judgment or indifference to avoid doing that kind of thing.

""...on promotion is to be the rate of pay nearest that to which the person was entitled in his or her substantive level immediately before the appointment that gives the person an increase in pay as specified in Subsection 2.2.3 above or an amount equal to at least 4 per cent of the maximum rate of pay for the position to which he or she is appointed when the salary for the position to which the appointment is made is governed by performance pay.""",True,,1514946107.0,1514917307.0,,t3_7nnnh8,t3_7nnnh8,4,0,0

From the T&C of employment, the movement is a promotion if:

>>  [2.2.2.3] the maximum rate of pay applicable to the position to which that person is appointed exceeds the maximum rate of pay applicable to the person’s substantive level immediately before the appointment by [...] [2.2.2.3(a)] an amount equal to at least the lowest pay increment for the position to which he or she is appointed, 

The AS-1 maximum rate of pay is $57,643/yr, which is $6,125 higher than CR-4's maximum of $51,518.  The smallest pay increment for AS-1 is $1,960 between the first two steps, so the new appointment is therefore a promotion.

To establish the rate of pay on promotion, turn to the next clause of the T&C:

>> [2.2.2.4] [T]he rate of pay on promotion is to be the rate of pay nearest that to which the person was entitled in his or her substantive level immediately before the appointment that gives the person an increase in pay as specified in Subsection 2.2.3

So, your new rate of pay would need to be at least $53,478, or your current $51,518 plus the $1,960 minimum increment.  That rate of pay is closest to step 2 of AS-01, which is where you should be placed.

Most people are confusing the pay system (Phoenix) with the operators of the system (Pay Centre) by calling it all Phoenix.  If people don't target the culprits, they lose the case.

You've stumbled upon a manifestation of this phenomenon. In indeterminate public service world, it's not at all unusual for someone to sign a Letter of Offer on their first day of work, and -- by extension -- it's also not unheard-of for public servants who are transferring to a new position or a new department to have open-ended start dates, of the ""we expect a letter of offer to show up sometime between March 14th and the end of April, and we'd like you to start within a day or two of the letter arriving"" variety. (And what's more, if they underestimate the timing and the letter doesn't land until June, that's normal and healthy and your outgoing manager will just deal with it -- and if the process jumps the rails and the letter never shows up at all and the whole thing gets cancelled, your manager will just deal with *that*, too, and you keep your job, and that's that.) Lots of managers quite rightly hate having to deal with the uncertainty and wibbly-wobbliness of this process, but they're contractually obligated to do so (and they also benefit from it in turn), so they put up with it.

But in the real world, your external manager *doesn't* have to accommodate any of it. Some of them will be friendly and civil about it, but others will want you to nail down a date and will hold you to it, even if things pile up with the Letter of Offer or it gets pulled altogether. (So if you agree on a final date of March 13th, and come March 7th you learn that the Letter of Offer won't actually be ready until June... too bad! You're unemployed for a few months. Sorry.)

With that in mind, my recommendations to external applicants are:

1. State plainly that you aren't comfortable resigning from your current position without a signed Letter of Offer in hand.
2. In discussions around start dates, emphasize that you need to give [x] weeks of notice to your employer. For example, ""Yes, June 5th is fine by me -- but do bear in mind that, in all cases, I need to give my employer [x] weeks of notice in advance of my departure, so to make a June 5th start date, I would need a Letter of Offer by May 13th at the latest.""
3. Do nothing to jeopardize your current employment until these criteria are satisfied. Don't mention it to your boss or coworkers, don't drop hints, don't send emails from your corporate account, etc. 

Some public service managers will push back on these tactics, and you may have to decide how much risk you're willing to endure: do you trust the oral offer, are you satisfied that they'll meet the deadline, are you comfortable giving notice on the information available to you, etc. These are judgement calls, and we really can't help you with them.",True,,1514614660.0,1514585860.0,,t3_7mxazm,t3_7mxazm,20,0,0

There is zero accountability for managers and the HR staff they rely on to get the process in order.  So for example, if Karen in HR has a headache for a week and decides to stay home, that letter will sit in purgatory until she decides its important enough to complete.

2) provide your manager with a document outlining the reasons you wish to start at a higher increment than the bottom for your category.  Please see the criteria below as they are the only reasons for paying you higher than the minimum.  If the job is lower level or low skill, chances are lower that this will be supported.

-there are unusual difficulties in filling the position with properly qualified candidates (for example, the minimum rate of pay is not competitive with the rates offered by local or regional employers for similar duties); or
-operational conditions require the presence of a highly skilled or experienced person who can assume the full duties of the position immediately upon taking employment (for example, there is no alternative but to pay above the minimum because training a novice person would impose an unacceptable burden on the employing organization).",True,,1514615679.0,1514586879.0,,t3_7mxazm,t3_7mxazm,4,0,0

I am friends with someone who took unpaid education leave for 1.5 years at NRCan. 

What actually takes place in reality is very different from what is on paper. It really depends on your team and the nature of your work. I would suggest, once you start working and if you feel you have a good relationship with your manager, to drop hints that that is what you would eventually like to do (emphasis on eventually, and obviously don't talk about it until you have proven yourself). You'll get a sense pretty quickly what is or is not possible. 

Taking unpaid education leave is the easiest for managers to deal with, and probably why it is the most common. But I *have* heard of people getting part of their studies covered.

You can find a full table of the historical contribution rates as a Google Spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hvYmwecFMD3P4aP1lig9HKXhoUKtxLqm9-BpUjrH0qM/edit?usp=sharing

The ""low"" contribution rate (for earnings up to the amount covered by CPP) was 4% of salary from 2001 to 2005, and then started going up.

By 2008, it was 4.9%. In 2012 it was 6.2%, and in 2018 it will be 9.83%. That's nearly double!

The ""high"" rate (for earnings above the CPP maximum) went from 8.40% in 2008 to 12.13% in 2018, a 50% increase!

While I think it's awesome that we have a good pension plan, it's frustrating to see that the amount every employee has been forced to contribute (it's a mandatory pay deduction after all) has gone up by such a large amount, with *no increase in pension benefits*. 

The contribution rates are entirely set by Treasury Board as far as I can tell. Doesn't this mean that every increase in rates is effectively a pay cut? There's less take-home pay available for each employee if the contributions go up, right?

If you just have a spreadsheet for them to update without call letter and reminder coordinated by DGO, it won't work. Some ideas are below:

1. Proper folder structure (shared/GC Doc) that is accessible by directors and their reps is likely the most important:
* organize by year, and within each separate folders for strategic, PMO specific task, ad-hoc requests that will accept response from directors, etc
* shared hot file spreadsheet for projects/strategic item that need to be updated weekly/monthly (call letter coordinated by DGO)
* when a request completed, clean up and move the entire request to archive folder
* call letters for ad-hoc requests should be coordinated by DGO and send to the rep/director/manager with due date: need to be firm on request and reminder
2. Private/restricted shared one-note: for strategic info between directors and DG, meeting minutes, etc. E.g. DGO/DG could simply input agenda for meeting what DG wants to know for the meeting and director will update directly in shared one-note.
3. Use outlook calendar all day event item for reminders

Sometimes if you made it to the best fit interview, it is really a choice between 3-4 candidates and you cannot really get a debrief for that, or at least a useful one. The hiring manager may have someone in mind already but HR requires those best fit forms, so they must meet a few candidates, which is a waste of time for everyone. Sometimes the person may have experience that while not essential for the position, would be an asset (even if not requested on the poster), etc.

And sometimes if you fail the exam or interview, you may simply not have the right experience. This is when the debrief is the most important, because if you failed a question about a specific policy, next time you'll study and most likely get a good score, but if it is something that you can only get through experience, now you can ask your current supervisor to get that experience or do a lateral move. These are not short-term solutions, but we all know people who have moved up without the proper experience and it is never a good thing.

Don't despair, I've had a colleague at my level who did excellent work, then our positions were reclassified and we had to compete for them, we thought we'd both get the new jobs, but I did and she did not... well it took her 3 years before she finally made it to the next level, and she was very competent.

Do those preparation to interview courses. Expand your knowledge, gain different experience. Don't feel entitled, apply to positions you can win and in which you can perform, but don't be afraid to ask for help to get there, and you'll be successful.

You could probably classify all positions in those categories:

- Clerk
- Administrative
- Professional
- Mid-Level Management (aka ""Team leads"" or ""Managers"" or ""Directors"" depending on the position, running daily operations)
- Executive / Senior Executive (aka Director, DG, etc. giving orientations, not involved in day to day operations other than being the boss of the mid-level managers)

I knew PLQ staffers that moved to Ottawa to work for the conservatives (Before and just after PLQ's loss in 2012).

After Harpers goverment got defeated  some of them managed to get back in to provincial cabinets in the Couillard Goverment.   

Some staffers end up rotating between federal , provincial and municipal cabinets.  Generally they come from well connected backgrounds. Since it's really a ""who you know"" world.

Pay is an issue, almost all staffers in Quebec felt undepaid.  There is a gap in between Quebec and Canads civil servants and it does show even for exempt employees.

From what i found online the budget of a Quebec cabinet  minister is about 600-700k. (someone who has a more important porfolio, can have 700-800k budget )  Generally a cabinet minister have about dozen people working for him/her.   Substract the cheif of staff that earns 110-130k and  there isn't that much left for everyone else. 

The info can be found here. https://www.tresor.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/PDF/acces_information/demandes_acces/1617/02.pdf

I'm trying to look up the average budget for a federal cabinet minister but found nothing so far.  Except for JT budget being close to 9 mil.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/prime-minister-s-office-trudeau-harper-kent-expenses-public-accounts-1.4382310

Also the [maximal amount](www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/document/34863.html) a staffer in Quebec can get is 84 335$  (no more than an acuatry working the quebec civil service) , while for the feds i think it's up [AS-8 level](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pubs_pol/hrpubs/mg-ldm/2011/pgmo-pldcm03-eng.asp)

The article talks about job security,  but it's truily inexistant for exempt employees. A staffer can be hired today and fired tomorrow at the ministers discression. 
the only advantage with Trudeau is that the election is in 2019 and he's likely to get reelected.

Exclusions aka ""policy breeches"" are entirely possible; I do them all the time. We do have flexibility to book hotels and flights, within reason. My management is willing to allow a fairly well defined set of breeches, so this is usually not an issue with staff. We can stay in conference hotels, we can choose flights with shorter layovers or direct routes to save time, for example. 

Short-booking (less than two days before travel) and changes while on travel status are, in fact, easy. Call the HRG line and do it with an operator. In every case I've had to use the phone line, I've found the operators to be very helpful. I'm tempted to do this all the time frankly, but it does cost more than using the web tool.

The mechanics of travel to Europe are not that different to domestic travel. It is very different in terms of the departmental travel plan, and in terms of budgeting, but it's not any more difficult to do in terms of travel arranging. The government MC travel card works great in Europe (and elsewhere). Note that flights to Europe do not qualify as long enough for business class upgrades for most people.

The travel claims are where most of our staff have issues. As an application, HRG expense claims cause very significant problems for all our staff. Error rates are up considerably since it came in as the payment claims process is so incredibly arcane. So, my recommendation to all our staff is to work closely with our travel advisors to get it right. Travel rules are ever-changing as well, which doesn't help.

I travel a half-dozen times a year or so. I used to travel 20+ times a year back in the mid-2000s, but that's cut way back these days, and I can't say I miss it.

My first trip was on one day notice, and only found out about the flight the day of. However, typically you have some time to book flights, hotels and the rest of it. The typical protocol is establish the trip/meeting is happening, prepare a travel authorization form, get that approved, book your flights, then your hotels, complete your initial claim, do the travel, complete the actual costs, and get paid out for your expenses. 


We use HRG for booking of airlines, which is a bit of a pain in the butt to be honest. You can find airlines, and typically it is market pricing, but sometimes there are issues. If you have to call them for support, it is $60 per call. Further to that, using vouchers is a hit or miss scenario, so never build in a voucher into your TAF. 


We book our own hotels (within the city limit calculator as much as we can) and utilise our own cards for food and other expenses. Claims typically take about 25 minutes to complete, and are in your account in less than a week. However, my department is one of the few that does not use HRG for the full process. 


As for your questions, booking flights/hotels is not too bad of a procedure but you need to look around to find some deals. There is some flexibility, as in we normally will fly in the night before to allow for morning meetings or anything like that. I have loved the opportunity to travel, and have now travelled with my Director, DG, ADM and by myself. Each presents its own challenges, but overall the experience has been good. As well, I am new to the PS, so have generally tried to keep costs down with taking metro/busses instead of taxis ect. It is a privilege to travel on government work, and I do not want to abuse it. 


A quick addition, your travel will greatly change depending on who you are going with. For instance, travelling with an ADM, your days are going to be typically long, and planned down to the minute with formal meetings. While travelling with my director it has been more informal meetings and allowed for some flexibility in case things ran long. Make sure you have a business card to hand out!

I travel less than I used to, but still go on a few trips each year.  The government uses HRG as it's travel services provider. It's basically an online platform where you select your flights, you can book your hotel (but you can book directly too), book your train tickets, etc. The same platform is used for your expenses report. The platform isn't super user-friendly, but it ain't too bad. Admin assistants will usually handle the travel requests and expenses reports, but sometimes you have to do it yourself.

This is covered by the [**Directive on Terms and Conditions of Employment**](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#secA.2). A manager with the appropriate authority (who may be more senior than the manager who is hiring you) needs to explain how one or more of the following circumstances applies:

>there is a shortage of skilled labour in the field involved, as evidenced by local or regional labour market surveys from recognized institutions;

>there are unusual difficulties in filling the position with properly qualified candidates (for example, the minimum rate of pay is not competitive with the rates offered by local or regional employers for similar duties); or

>operational conditions require the presence of a highly skilled or experienced person who can assume the full duties of the position immediately upon taking employment (for example, there is no alternative but to pay above the minimum because training a novice person would impose an unacceptable burden on the employing organization).

If you can make a good case for why one of the above circumstances applies, you could argue that you should start at a higher step level. Chances are good, though, that you won't be able to do this. Experience as a FSWEP/Co-op student is not the same as experience as a regular employee. I'd be grateful that you're starting at step 2 instead of at the bottom - they are already offering you a higher salary than what you're entitled (your salary as a casual has no bearing on your salary when first hired as an employee).

Since I moved to a new department though, the new department put in my vacation leave and sick leave entitlements as if I were brand new to the PS and not 10 years in. So I'm missing a vast amount of sick and annual leave that should be inputted along with my transfer. I'm actually going to contact the Pay Centre this week just to ask if they've even received paperwork on my transfer/promotion.

I know 6 months is not that long to wait (I was told 1-2 YEARS which is so ridiculous), but I don't want to go for 1.5 years and then all of a sudden get $15 000 backpay which will screw me up for taxes (although I think you can put in a claim if you end up in a new tax bracket due to Phoenix issues).

So likely you will keep getting paid at your current substantive and within about a year, you will get your promotion. Then they will issue the back pay whenever they get to it. Also keep track of increments because if they don't promote you until close to your increment date, you may still not get paid correctly.

I had retro paid on my old position, which worked out ok since they think I'm still in that position so no change, but they did issue me a signing bonus that I'm not entitled to and some retro pay for a time period that fell after I transferred.

In my field, my network yielded me a non-advertised promotion :)  So it can pay off.  I support a bunch of different functions, so having a strong/large network is super useful.  You learn a lot from peers, and have a good system of favour-trading. 

I think networking is more valuable as you make your way up the chain.  In the earlier part of my career, it helped me to have a few contacts when I wanted to research stuff, but it didn't really help me advance my career (beyond improving my skills).

Managers are being encouraged to hire using non-advertised, if it can stand-up to scrutiny.  So wouldn't be terrible for you to make sure that people know your name, know what you can do, and keep some people in your network that work in areas that are of interest to you.

Ensure you have between 3-5 months of sick leave saved up in case something does happen. It will help bridge the gap in case you need to go on long term medical.

Volunteer day and personal day does not role over, so utilise it before you burn your vacation days. (I personally am actually using them for their intended reason)

Loyalty only goes so far, and although a Director or DG might say something, unless it is in writing you have no leg to stand on. This goes for acting assignments, deployments, promotions, or any other major or minor move. 

Ask for clarification if you are not sure on what to do. Nothing is worse than going up the chain to only realise it was not what they wanted. 

Different audiences demand a different voice IE if a deck or BN is ripped apart, do the fixes, and see where they changed wording. This way you know the next time you write a BN to ADM you word it like x

Keep a copy of all your paperwork, security and courses you have taken. 


Always be aware of opportunities, even if you love your job, you might need a change quickly due to management change or life change. Keep your options open, and do not burn bridges. Ottawa is a small town, and if you burn bridges at one department, it may trickle down to your new one.

If you want to move into management, you will need to care about the annual reports of the Privy Council which tells departments the direction government is going, especially with regime changes following elections.  Pay attention to departmental priorities as they will flow from direction by the Privy Council.  These priorities are conveyed to all managers and are published on the web site. 

Get your manager to provide you with a clear vision of how his or her mandate is to be carried out.  His or her objectives will flow from departmental priorities.  Negotiate your own objectives and make sure you have career development built into your performance agreement.  

As for getting things in writing, that isn't always going to happen.  I had an ADM give me a green light for a project verbally and I went with it.  The project aligned with current priorities.  There was no problem.

If you are asked to do something that seems loose, you can try to get it in writing but you can simply write an e-mail explaining what you have been asked to do, voice your concerns, and then proceed.  That gives you manager a chance to correct your understanding.  If not, he or she cannot deny having known in advance because it's in their inbox.  They will be held accountable if something is wrong.  Make sure your e-mail is retrievable.

If it is dangerous (health and safety), legally you refuse.  If it is illegal, you refuse but understand that might not be an easy option.  It's the right one.  Even a bad manager has a lot of power and cause problems.  Senior management in the Public Serivce is not good at dealing with bad managers until a lot of damage has been inflicted.  In fact, it's just as bad in the private sector.  Bad managers only get dealt with in the private sector if it costs the company money.  In gov't profit isn't a consideration so unless senior managers are paying attention to performance indicators like staff turnover, increased use of sick leave etc., if can go unaddressed for years.

Whatever you do, do it well or don't do it at all.  If your manager finds your work only partially done or incorrectly done nothing else will matter.  You become a liability rather than an asset.  Know your subject matter really well but also know related subject matters as well.  

Try to be multi-disciplinary.  Volunteer for projects that seem to be going somewhere.  The ""stripping files project"" would be something to avoid.

A department like ESDC (are they still ESDC?) hires a lot of people who join up and stay in a single job forever, because that's Service Canada for you: if you work at the Fort St. John Service Canada counter, you're probably not going to move around except to occupy a supervisory position should one come available.

Yup. I wasn't asked for proof, but my supervisor has known my spouse for a while. If someone asks, two pieces of mail in each of your names to the same address is usually plenty.

>Question 2: How much advance notice does she have to give her home department prior to going on the leave without pay?

You don't have to, but I gave my supervisor plenty of heads up as soon as we knew a move was a possibility, told him when the move was unofficially announced, and staffed the paperwork immediately after we had paperwork. I wrote a simple memo to my section head, referencing the policies in the collective agreement and the departmental leave manual, and attached a copy of her job offer. We had enough lead time for my boss to begin scouting out new candidates for a transfer to our team, and for me to give an overview of the job to all interested candidates. Helping in the transition made for a smooth departure and avoided any burned bridges.

>Question 3: Can anyone speak to their experience with the spousal relocation priority list and if they received an offer based off it.

I haven't been referred to anything yet, mostly because there are very few positions in my classification in the area. The suggestion I got was to grab some org charts, see what activities my department had out there, and start sending emails to any section heads and team leads where I might fit. Everyone I reached out to was supportive, and one indicated his team might expand in the future and said he'd keep me in mind. So start the legwork now; you might get lucky and find a spot. Plus, I've been told that showing up with a priority hire makes you an attractive candidate since there are fewer staffing hurdles.

Other tips:

If you don't have a job lined up for the new location, apply for EI benefits as soon as you're settled. Relocation of spouse is just cause for leaving your job. It isn't a princely sum, but it sure helps tide you over.

Print out your last few pay stubs before you leave. It took the pay centre several months to generate an ROE. It may be better now, but if you don't have an ROE, Service Canada can make one up for you based on your pay stubs. Also print out any records of courses or training, and anything else you want to have easily accessible when applying for jobs.

Speaking of the pay centre, take any pay you receive after you leave and park it in a high-interest savings account. A few online banks routinely offer bonus interest on new deposits, so take advantage and make a few extra bucks. Don't be tempted to invest it; Murphy's Law says they'll come looking for it just as the fund bottoms out.

Once the pay centre does process your file, you'll be sent a package detailing your options for opting into or out of health and dental insurance. Pension is handled separately, so you can call the pension service centre for an estimate of the buyback, if you wish.

If you've ever been curious about working in the private sector, now's your chance! You can increase your breadth of experience, and if it doesn't work out, you still have your priority status to fall back on if you want to go back to the PS. Or try something totally different.

You are in the best position right now. Most people who graduate secondary education who do not pursue post-secondary education or training are often in more financially precarious situations. You have the time and security to figure out what you want and act upon it. Take advantage of it.

If you want money, go be an elevator technician. Or not, I mean, you should obviously do more research for a life-changing decision than listening to me. :P But if your real interest is money, do the research and do it seriously. Most suggestions (actuary, investment banker, silicon valley software developer etc.) are always easier said than done. And be realistic about your chances. For competitive industries, if you do not have the attitude and aptitude, you can be out-hustled by those who really want it.

You talk about missed earnings and it's true that you will be missing out on some earnings but many post-secondary options you pursue may have co-op or internship opportunities. These will pay something and for tech, may even pay more than your current salary depending on where you work. In fact, I would be wary of any post-secondary that does not have a component that ensures you graduate with experience.

The last question is about where you want to be geographically. You are in the Atlantic region. Do you want to stay there? Are you willing to move? Part of your research should include where you could work with whatever post-secondary education to pursue.

Since I am in the CS group, I am not super-familiar with other classifications but I heard that you can go pretty far without any post-secondary education in the Public Service. That should be another thing you should research. But once again, it's about attitude and aptitude.

The first thing you have to remember when working for the government is that you won't be rich; you will be comfortable.

The second thing I would recommend doing is look around you and see what is your possible career progression where you work. Talk to your management:

1. Can you qualify with your current experience and knowledge in higher positions within your team should they open up?

2. Can your experience and education make you eligible to apply on other positions within the government and allow better upward movement?

If the answer is no on the first one, than even if 2 is a yes, it's a risky yes, as you are dependant on the position having the clause ""education or experience at managers discretion"".

Can you maybe work out an agreement with your current management to go part-time to school and work less than an FTE without compromising your position? Yes, you will get in debt doing that, but you will have a job guarantee in case you don't like what you are doing.

But let's look at the financial aspect of it, specifically engineering:

* Average salary of a [mechanical engineer](https://www.payscale.com/research/CA/Job=Mechanical_Engineer/Salary): 66K

* Average salary of a [civil engineer](https://www.payscale.com/research/CA/Job=Civil_Engineer/Salary): 64K

* Average salary of a [electrical enginee](https://www.payscale.com/research/CA/Job=Electrical_Engineer/Salary)r: 68K

Now, guessing that in your case, based on your salary, I would say an educated guess of your position is either CR05 (between 52k-56k pay range). Even if next negotiations happen, you will top at 57-59K.

Eventually, the gross cost of life index will catch up to you and will outpace you.

As you said, you are just 24 years old with no dependent... but what happens when your personal life changes and you decide to settle down, buy a house, and possibly start a family?

My advise is this:
Don't look at the financial aspect of it. While it is important and will have an impact on your future, decide what you want to do in life. Engineering, IT, policy, etc... who knows. 

Like you said you are young and you are in a good position to decide what you want to do without sacrificing your current employment.

In a few weeks you'll get the credit for November to increase your sick leave bank to 271.875 hours (assuming that you don't use any sick days in the near future). Sick leave keeps growing each month unless you use it up. 

It's a good idea to aim for a minimum of 13 weeks of banked sick leave (around 500 hours) as insurance if you suffer a major disability. The long-term disability plan doesn't provide benefits until you have used up all your paid sick leave, or after 13 weeks, whichever is longer.

The vacation looks about right too. You get advanced your full year (12 months) of vacation credits in April. 12 months times 9.375h/month is 112.5h per year, which gets added to any unused vacation leave from previous years (up to a limit, but you aren't near it yet). 

For your first eight years of service you accrue sick leave at the same rate as vacation leave - 9.375h/month, which equates to three weeks per year for each type of leave.

You can verify your pay rate by taking you biweekly *gross* salary, multiplying by 26.088 to get the yearly salary, and comparing against your collective agreement.

> I have always been paid a (more or less) correct amount on time (crossing fingers). Nevertheless, can anyone explain the fluctuations?

Not from the bottom line, since the net salary paid is given by gross salary less deductions.  These can vary:

* Gross salary changes with pay increments and with yearly economic increases (while the collective agreement is not expired)
* Taxes change over the year because deductions for CPP and EI cap out.  These are assessed only on income up to the yearly maximum pensionable earnings level, which is (this year) the first $55.9k of *gross* salary.
* Pension deductions also change at this level.  Salary up to the YMPE level is 'coordinated' with the CPP (that is, gives a lower benefit in retirement) and hence has a smaller contribution rate; salary above this level has a [higher](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/pension-plan/plan-information/public-service-pension-glance.html#toc3) contribution rate.
* *But*, pension contributions are themselves tax-deductible, so contributing at a higher rate reduces the CIT deduction.

In your case, my guess is that as of October 4^(1) you capped out your CPP earnings for the year because of the retroactive pay.  The following pay period you were were no longer paying CPP/EI, but you were still paying the 'low' pension rate because *this* year's salary had not exceeded the YMPE limit.  Subsequently you exceeded this year's YMPE line and began paying at the 'high' rate.

Additionally, your 1 Nov pay did not take deductions for PSHCP (if you signed up for extra hospital coverage), union dues, death benefits, or long-term disability; these are collected on the last two pays in a month for months with three paydates.
