So my job situation kind of went to crap this week, and I'm wondering if anyone has any insight in terms of how long my situation could take to be resolved, or if it sounds like it's not going to be resolved at all.


So, basically, i'm currently working as a casual and was set to be brought on as an indeterminate employee at the end of my contract. The position was approved for staffing, and we got to the point where the DG was supposed to sign off on funding for the position. The request for this was put in last Monday (April 23), but when things weren't moving along, my HR person inquired as to what was going on and was told that ""all staffing was to be put on a standstill until further notice."" When my boss asked about this, he was told that all staffing in our department is being stopped due to the ""budget for the new fiscal year."" As I understand it, they didn't get as much money as they were expecting to get, and are in the process of trying to get more. My position isn't the only one affected by this standstill, if that matters.


Up until this point, both my boss and the HR person handling my file had been pretty confident that I'd be getting this position. I had even been told that my new start date would probably be sometime next week. Now, they pretty much aren't sure of anything.


So, does this sound like the end of the road for me? Or does it just sound like I'll be starting later on? If so, any ideas on how much later?


Thank you in advance!

Im not sure what exactly I want to get into (e.g. policy) however I havent been exposed to it so Im not sure if Id like it or not. I wouldve done some co-op placements with the government, however by the time I realized it was a place I wanted to be, my co-op terms were over. 

Also, Im exploring some Masters programs that I would hopefully get into for 2019 (MPS, MPPA, MPA) with the goal of networking, getting some placements within government and being exposed to the workings and nuances of government on a theoretical level.

Id appreciate any comments on what the public service is like, things I need to know and how I could explore different roles (so as to focus my career plans). Also, would having a Masters help for career advancement?

I am feeling quite a bit of anxiety about this, and am looking for some advice.

On my first day of reporting to my new boss, I was pulled into their office and lectured quite strongly. I was essentially told I am being performance managed, despite two years of positive performance reviews and leading an extremely productive and and successful team (in fact, I have one of the most engaged groups in the department). This caught me by surprise, as there has been no indications my performance was off-track.

Therefore, I am left thinking that this is personal and due to my personality. I'm not a super happy-go-lucky person, and given my role, have had to be the devil's advocate for the department, which has made me not popular with some people who only want validation for their ideas (despite items being brought forward for discussion/debate).

55,8ev6x1,t5_3f8vd,How do we actually make gcconnex useful for collaboration?,19,flyinghippos101,,,False,False,t3_8ev6x1,False,False,False,"During my short time in the public service, Ive noticed a keen interest by the Government to leverage GCTools to capitalize on social media-lite tools for improving collaboration. I can get behind the principle of this initiative, but what Im finding (anecdotally and based on convos with colleagues) is that substantive use so far, apart from job postings,
 seems minimal among GC Employees. I argue that part of this problem is its current community of users and the unreconciled tension of having public servants be frank about improving processes.

In my opinion, there seems to be something akin to an unraveling market with respect to the GCConnex community. By this I mean that the majority of frequent users post very similar content on innovation or workplace motivation blogs that appeal to a very narrow segment of the GC Employee user base. For example, the first 10 posts in my Wire Feed (excluding job postings) include: 4 on self-motivation/management style links, 2 invites for panel meetings, 2 links to policy articles, 2 one post on grassroots innovation vaguely, and only one on improving government processes. Evidently, the discussion typically revolves less on improving processes and more of a buzzword bingo/explosion (look no further than the bewilderingly vague and confusing OneTeamGov post on this sub)  and awkward echo-chamber situations where theyre the only people discussing with one another. 

As a result, many of my colleges have self-selected out of using the platform for actual collaboration, which creates a domino effect in which other colleagues opt out of using the platform because of its limited utility as a coordination tool. Hence an unraveling of the platform.

Furthermore, employees hired to promote GCConnex have unintentionally created a sterile, corporate, inorganic atmosphere, which is the antithesis of social media and obviously not conducive to having frank discussions (like this one). Specifically, this raises a more important question about how feasible an honest FB-esque platform is for a GC-endorsed, corporate platform, when Public Servants are above all expected to be ardently loyal to their departments and their ministers.  Just take a look at the About GCconnex, which describes it as a professional social collaboration platform that enables public servants to connect through shared experience, knowledge, groups or interests. Evidently, there seems to be some conceptual obstacles that the platform needs to transcend to improve.

Id like to point out that I truly believe that a platform like this would be very beneficial to share best practices, especially for policy practitioners, but it seems to be having a hard time getting off the ground and TBS doesnt seem to be stepping up. Nor do I want this to seem like I'm undercutting the hard work of gctools employees, or ignore some tangible examples of collaboration coming out of this platform. Just think that there are some very credible limitations standing in the way of it being more accessible and used more appropriately.

My recommedantions:

1.	Curtail significantly the activity of users tied exclusively to promote GCConnex. Let the platform develop on its own merits by the users interested enough to use it; the current model is stunting the developing of a gcconnex online community. these employees should be more of an enabling role for users, not just dictate convos

2.	Ensure GCConnex encourages Public Servants to ask uncomfortable questions and have frank conversations about Government Processes and ways to improve them (i.e TBS issue a mission statement for the platform). This will go far in reducing the freeze of frank discussions on the platform

*TL;DR*: GCConnexs user base is unintentionally preventing its wider adoption of the platform and is conceptually flawed. We should have the platform thats more organic and user-driven, and have TBS stress the importance of GCconnex as an important public servants discussion forum.

I had some serious medical issues last year (yes, I brought them up to a doctor), in a department which routinely gets too much work (definitely exacerbated the issues). I alerted my manager, but the real solution to my issues would have required my benefits to be active (and they were not, because of a Phoenix issue). I pulled through, but had minor performance issues (I say minor because all of the major job/performance indicia, work products, etc. were met; I worked more than minimum requirements, etc.).

Now my manager wants to put me on an action plan and says I have not met performance objectives as a result of mostly incidents that occurred during the time where I was having medical issues. The year-end assessment has been verbal and there are no specific examples, but generally the statement was that my general performance was short during that time. My capacity to do my job (which I've been doing the whole time...) has been questioned.

I still get the sense that they'd like to work with me through this action plan, but it also seems grossly unfair given the context (medical issues which were exacerbated through Phoenix not getting me the benefits which I really needed; actually meeting all performance requirements for the job; getting too much work).

67,8eo3ak,t5_3f8vd,Question concerning HR,5,PatrickMB84,,,False,False,t3_8eo3ak,False,False,False,"A couple months ago I was involved in a process for an acting position in my department, same group as mine actually.i wasn't the successful candidate but I felt there was a conflict of interest as part of the process and once i got the email for a postboard I asked the question about what was done to mitigate the conflict, if anything. I requested a follow up to the questions in writing as opposed to a face to face interview as I wasn't too keen on this turning into a he said/she said kind of thing if something went sideways. I got my answer eventually and that was that.

Today, after a few other things popped up I wrote to my manager, who was the hiring manager of the process and just stated my concerns with my position in the group and asked what I could do moving forward to get some much needed supervisory experience/skills within the group. He replied saying my email was lengthy but that he'd like to sit down and talk about it.

I agreed, however asked that someone from the dispute resolution group be present as an unbiased observer as things haven't been so smooth between us since the whole raising the potential conflict of interest. Immediately I received an email back stating that he complied with my request previously (to have a response  in writing) against HRs recommendation and that if I wanted to discuss my email then it would need to be mediated by our senior director. So, a meeting with my manager, senior director and myself was the only way I was having a meeting to discuss my concerns. To be clear here, I never asked for a meeting or a reply to my email. I gladly would have met with him if someone unbiased was also in the room.

My question though, is about the HR comment. It can't honestly be common place for HR to suggest having a face to face conversation over having something in writing. Sure you can pull stuff from an email and make it say a different story but you can always go back and get that string of emails for context and a face to face conversation can easily turn into a he said/she said thing.

After reading through my offer I noticed a bit about how I am compensated based on the TBS definitions etc. etc.  So the thought finally struck me to double check to see if my new status involved a pay raise.  

Based on the [TBS](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pubs_pol/hrpubs/coll_agre/rates-taux-eng.asp) I am eligible for pay raises ever 52 weeks (26 pay periods).

as a term employee you get pay raises every 52 wks or 26 pp, until you are indeterminate. One exception was the Level X restructuring which I do believe was effective 21/06/2016 despite anniversary increments.

** pay table below and [psac payment calendar here](http://psacunion.ca/sites/psac/files/attachments/pdfs/govtcalendar2015-16.pdf)

    Level B pay periods
    15/10/2015 (level B) until 20/06/2016 = 18 pay periods
    $0 net gain, assume they paid me correctly to start.

    Level X Pay periods
    21/06/2016 - 15/10/2016 = 8 pp **level x until first anniversary**
    $0 net gain, assuming again that because this was mandatory that it was implemented properly,
    I think I remember being lucky to be included in this pay bump. Let's assume it was done correctly.

    Level C
    16/10/2016 - 15/10/2017 = 26 pp
    Step 1 pay = $50274k
    Should have been at Step 2 = $52838k
    $2,564 underpaid

    Level D
    16/10/2017 - 15/10/2018 = 26 pp
    Step 1 pay = $50,902
    Should have been paid at step 3 = $55,530
    $4,628 underpaid

    Total underpayment
    $7,192


Am I doing this right? I would really like if someone could give me some advice about this, I am saving for a down payment on my first home and I don't want to count on this money if there's some issue with my calculation or for some reason am illegible for the underpayment.

two weeks later I had a meeting with my supervisor and director and was given a two days noticed of termination. The reasons given were:

* being behind in training 

* and unauthorized days off 

After that was said my director pulled off a bunch of printed emails exchanges I had with other potentials employers and I was told that this should be a lesson how in the public service word gets around.

I was never given any feedback of any kind during my six months here, nor any review of my work. My supervisor and I had an agreement that I could switch my workings days by letting her know the day prior via text or email. Throughout my tenure I was told often by my supervisor how amazing would be to work for the team. 

Two days after being fired I was told me they would allow me to finish my contract that runs out at the end of April because firing me would be too much paper work.

The issue I have right now that I have been rejected now for two positions I was considered pretty much hired after the interviews because the unsolicited bad references my supervisor and director have given. I feel I have been blacklisted within my department.

I truly do no understand whats going on. After being fired I told my supervisor that I would like to get a performance review and feedback of my work to emphasize in my weaknesses and work on them. I am still a student and I understand I can make mistake and I don't know everything. What feels unjust is that I was never given the proper feedback about my work and the opportunity to fix my errors. 

They reviews I got were so bad that my references reach out to me asking me if I was hiding something from them or something happened at work that they should know before given references from me again.

I wanted to get a head start on the application process so that I'd be covered ASAP once I was eligible, so I started that on Phoenix. It now shows what plans and things I'm covered under, and the deductions for coverage are coming out of my paycheque, but I don't have any info so I'm confused. I haven't done positive enrolment because I haven't received any information to do so, so I'm wondering why I'm contributing toward benefits NOW if I'm not eligible. Did I bone myself by trying to jump the gun? It also says that dental doesn't require enrolment, so is it just on the same card for the health plan that I'll get (eventually)? And I can just hand this card over to the dentist whenever I go and they go ""yep, ok, you pay 20%""?

The system isn't stopping me, but clearly I'm eligible for only one of them. Where can I find that information? I don't see it in my collective agreement anywhere and the plan directive is not clear on what these levels are and which one I am eligible for.

I first got a security clearance through a staffing agency that had contracted me to work for another department (say, Department A) last year.

The dilemma is that I'm pregnant and will be going on mat leave in 6 months. I'm scared that my pay file won't have transferred by that time and the paperwork will be a nightmare. I'm the sole provider for my family as my husband is a student. 

I'm considering taking one of the offers that is less good solely because of my worry about Phoenix. Is this crazy? 

I should note that 2 years ago I had to go on disability for a couple months. My pay file was messed up for 11 months, I didn't get paid for 6 months of that time. I'm terrified of this happening again when I'm post partum. It was difficult enough when I was in pain and recovering.

So, my wife and I are currently trying to have a baby. 

I work in finance and I need to take some accounting classes because i'm able to go for my CPA designation (cours de mise à niveau as they are called in French.. not sure of the proper English expression for this) . I have 13 classes to take in total to make up the difference in beetween my undergraduate finance degree and the accounting degree. I can submit my application for the diplôme d'études supérieures en comptabilité professionelle.

Currently I'm taking one evening class per semester working toward that objective.   

I was wondering if they're is any rule against taking university classes during your parental leave? Could I get into trouble with my employee if I did this? I've read the section about parental leave in the collective agreement and i've seen nothing on this matter  but I just wanted to make sure before going ahead with my plan :) 

I'm well aware than the logistics of juggling beetween taking care of  a newborn baby and studying for 4-5 university classes could get complicated but this post is not about that :) At least, we wouldn't have to worry about paying the bills thanks to the parental allowance.

153,8bzkld,t5_3f8vd,Why does the government and atmosphere have a negative attitude towards contractors?,4,techcrium,,,False,False,t3_8bzkld,False,False,False,"During my time in the public service, I've witnessed many direct and indirect negativity towards contractors...all the way from management down to the employees.

Some examples:

1. Contractors are not allowed to participate in social activities. No christmas activities; halloween; etc. Attitude is: You are here to do your work and GTFO

2. They don't get many email circulations; Staffing updates, new systems, division wide meetings, etc. When I ask a colleague contractor, hey did you know we are doing a re-org of ABC? He replies, ""oh I'm not even in on those emails!""

3. Contractors often share a cubicle with other contractors and get very minimal supplies; When there's a space issue, its contractors first that will have to move or move in with another.

4. When employees are chatting amongst themselves about private life; it is mostly ok. When contractors chat amongst themselves, they get called out by team leads/employees

5. Disparaging comments like, ""oh you're a contractor, you are making the big bucks! You gotta do the work!""

6. At one of my workplaces, contractors get no ""air time"" with management. Managers and up, they are ""not allowed"" to talk to them. They can only address their team lead/direct supervisor with concerns.


I did the math and it looks like it pays more to be an employee than a contractor. For example: 

Top payscale for CS-02 is $86,200. 

Pension is worth $9,000 on top per year. 

Insurance is worth $3,000. 

Sick/family/personal/vacation is worth:
20 vacation + 6 family + 15 sick days + 2 personal = 43 leave days; 252 working days - 43 = 209 real working days

Indeterminate = Say its worth additional 15% on top of everything for having that job security and cannot be let go at any time.

98,200 * 1.15 = $112,900

$113,000 / 209 = $540 a working day

Most contractor positions are advertised from $450-$550, from many agencies. (I'm not even including the paid training days, work from home benefits for some, and compressed leave benefits aka less commute time)

So yeah, looks like employees get compensated just as well as contractors. Yet contractors are somehow required to work 3-4x more and they get no slack.

Apparently it was one of the recommendations from the OL report. 

Basically, the PSC is doing a pilot in which hiring managers can conduct their own language assessment of candidates using the assessment method of their choice (what I gathered from reading the hashtag). They record candidates and send the recording to the PSC, but the language experts at PSC don't validate the results, they just listen to recordings for their own internal studies on the pilot. 

Candidates cannot refuse to be assessed by the hiring manager (opting to be assessed by the PSC instead). So, that's kind of annoying for anyone implicated in the pilot. 

Having done a lot of coop interviews where managers tested my French proficiency informally, I can already say this method will probably yield complaints. I had some managers tell me my French proficiency was poor, and others told me it was great. My actual language test with the PSC yielded great results despite no language training, which goes to show how subjective informal language assessments can be. 

I encourage everyone to keep an eye out for the results of this pilot because this could impact hiring and language testing going forward if the PSC deems it ""successful.""

* I'm a recent graduate that joined the PS (F/T indeterminate) and currently on assignment.

* Not too long ago, I was re-tasked and assigned to another team, which normally requires significant experience in the PS, and is (apparently) highly sought after. This was a senior management decision based on needs (and recommendation from previous management); I didn't have a say in this.

* Since this has happened, my colleagues, who I thought were collegial and friends, have given me the cold shoulder and started spreading rumours/gossip: ""Who did they have to sleep with to get this job?""; ""they're probably looking for the flavour of the day""; ""they were never a team player and only cared about themselves""; ""let us find a way to use this to our advantage""; etc.

* Given that these are all senior staff, and the assignment decisions are also driven by needs and priorities, I might be sent back to this same team to this same environment.

I don't know how to navigate this environment and not burn bridges. To a certain extent, I know that I have to look after my own well-being, but was taken back by this type of behaviour/attitude in the PS and feel that I'm just a disposable resource.

207,8akxr5,t5_3f8vd,Question about service buyback,4,markinottawa,,,False,False,t3_8akxr5,False,False,False,"I recently left the Canadian Armed Forces with just under 14 years of service. I transitioned to a Federal Public Service position the day after I left the army and I'm trying to figure out what to do with my CAF pension.
I'm currently 40 and intend to stay in the Public Service until retirement, sometime between 55 to 60. I've done the math on several retirement scenarios, and I'm fairly confident that it makes the most sense for me to transfer my CAF pension to my PS pension, mainly since I'm making a lot more now, but also since it would allow me to reduce the penalty on my pension if I decide to retire before 60.
So, my question is whether I should transfer the pension or cash out my CAF pension and buy back my previous service.
At first I just thought it would be easiest to simply transfer my time, but then I decided to look into the buy back option and the numbers seem to be overwhelmingly in favour of buying back. I feel like I'm missing something here so I'm hopeful that someone can point out the error in my logic. Well, actually, I'm hopeful that I'm right here since it seems like a really good deal :)
My CAF pension statement says that my 5,065 days of service lump sum transfer value is $432k, $200k within tax limits and $232k outside of tax limits. I did a buyback estimate for the time based on my current salary using the CWA pension tool and it came to $138k. This seems to suggest that I could put the $200k into a LIRA until I'm 60, use $138k of the $232k to buyback my CAF service (I believe this is tax deductible), which would leave me with $94k that would be taxed as income (I don't have any more RRSP room).
This seems too good to be true. What am I missing here?

It's only been a few weeks and I can confirm that I have indeed been catfished. This was confirmed by the lady who interviewed me after she noticed my dissatisfaction.. I've been trying to hide it and put my best foot forward but I'm not an Oscar-level actor, I guess. We had a conversation and it basically confirmed all my suspicions.

Date Posted: 2018-04-03 
To: All staff 
Sent by: Treasury Board Secretariat 


The government is continuing to do everything it can to resolve pay problems and provide as much flexibility as possible for employees experiencing issues with their pay.

To help ensure that the recovery of overpayments related to a Phoenix issue minimizes financial hardship for employees, the government is introducing new measures:
The recovery of overpayments, emergency salary advances and priority payments related to a Phoenix issue will be managed in the same way. Unless an employee chooses an earlier repayment, recoveries will only start when: ?all of an employees pay problems are addressed, and
?the employee has received correct pay for three consecutive pay periods.

Public Services and Procurement Canada will be responsible for managing recoveries for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.
For employees on leave without pay, recoveries will not start until they return to work.
Employees will be provided all reasonable flexibility, to decide how they wish to make repayments. This includes delaying repayments until an employee receives monies owed, such as income tax refunds or the receipt of retroactive payments from the implementation of collective agreements.
If employees consider themselves to be in financial hardship, and have already agreed to a recovery plan before the current measures were put in place, they could ask for their plan to be modified in order to benefit from these new flexibilities.
Once all of an employees pay problems are fixed, the employee will be able to select from a number of options to repay the government, making changes when needed to better suit their situation.

It is important to note that the new measures do not apply to recoveries associated with termination of employment or the end of term or casual contracts that are not extended or renewed.

Details on how these new recovery processes will roll-out across departments and agencies will be finalized in the coming weeks. More information will be shared as it becomes available.

All employees are reminded that information and resources to assist with the Phoenix pay system are available on AgriSource. There are also claims processes in place to compensate employees who have incurred expenses or financial losses because of the implementation of the Phoenix pay system.

The government will continue to take a flexible approach toward addressing the needs of employees, and work in close collaboration with its union partners to minimize the financial impacts on employees due to Phoenix issues.

246,88gyuo,t5_3f8vd,Moving to Ottawa/Gatineau from out of province,6,pubservthrowaway,,,False,False,t3_88gyuo,False,False,False,"Hi everyone.

I will be working in the Little Italyish area soon (Booth St.) soon, sometime within the next few months. Looking for some advice re: Ottawa vs. Hull (Gatineau).

I am relocating from BC and am seriously considering moving to Hull and commuting over a bridge to work every morning. My annual salary will be $63,500, no kids or dependents, single-person household. I'm young and healthy (knock on wood), so I don't require loads of health care services at this moment. I would only live on the QC side for one or two years because my income will be substantially higher in 2020 and financially it would make more sense to live in Ontario. 

Using an income tax calculator, my net income (excluding extraneous work deductions like pension and union fees and the like) in Ontario will be $48,111 off of a gross $63,500. In comparison, if I live in QC, my net income (again, excluding deductions) will be $44,878. I will be making $3,233 more if I choose to live in Ontario. 

But I compared insurance rates too, and I'll be saving $850/yr if I live in QC (I am a new driver from BC so my rates will be $1650/yr in Ontario). I also estimate I'll be saving $300-400/month on a one-bedroom apartment if I live in QC. Thus, even with the higher taxes in QC, I'll still be $3,000 ahead as compared to if I lived in ON. 

What is a realistic commute from Hull to the Little Italy area? I have my own car. Google Maps shows a range between 16 minutes and 35 minutes during rush hour in the morning. Is it usually closer to the latter end of the scale? Will I really be driving 35 minutes to work every morning, or will it be much longer? 

I should add that a main reason for my wanting to move to QC for one year has to do with my BC license conversion. I have the BC equivalent of a G2 and yet Ontario doesn't recognize it as an equal and will force me to take a G2 test and then a G test. *I hate taking road tests with a burning, fiery passion.* I would do anything to avoid it. I have more than two years of (clean) driving experience and QC will give me a full license right away. Thus, not only will I be keeping $3,000 more of my money (per year) if I lived in QC, but I don't have to take another two road tests. Thank God. 

My main concerns regarding living in Hull has to do with the commute in the morning. I can handle a half-hour commute... it's just if it's one hour every morning, I'd really have to reconsider. I've grown up and lived in the ""ghettos"" of the Vancouver Lower Mainland, so I really don't mind that Hull is known for being grungy and dirty. 

Would love some advice/other considerations.

262,87zyeu,t5_3f8vd,Short Break in Employment Between FSWEP and Indeterminate?,3,PSECanThrowaway,,,False,False,t3_87zyeu,False,False,False,"Hello,

I wanted to ask you all if there is any downside to having a short break in employment between an FSWEP and indeterminate status? (e.g. for pension purposes, etc.)

I have been working in the federal government for co-op semesters full-time and FSWEP part-time during school semesters for 3 years now with no break in employment (this is by chance, I didn't purposely have a reason to not have a break in employment; and it was done all with the same employer). 

I will be bridged (through non-advertised, not student bridging) 30 days after my last FSWEP contract expires. This works out really well for me as within those 30 days I will have numerous exams for school and it will give me some downtime for more studying. However, my manager has offered to sign me to an FSWEP part-time contract for those 30 days now so I can keep working uninterrupted, if I want. 

Is there any benefit (other than obviously the salary for the few days worked within those 30 days) for me to sign an extension for those 30 days? Perhaps for pension buyback purposes? Without any additional benefit, it is tempting to not extend as I would likely need to take LWOP for a bunch of exams during that period anyway.

Backstory: I am currently an AS-03. Last year i got into a partially assessed AS-04 and AS-05 pool. In February I was sent an email as part of an opportunity coming from the pool. In that email they asked 4 specific questions (overtime, travel, etc.) nothing too crazy but they also asked for an updated resume. I answered all 4 questions and provided my updated resume.

Now comes the interview.  They only had 2 questions that werent already assessed in the pool. I came in second (of 4) apparently and knew my issue before they told me. I was interviewing with my manager and another supervisor in our group along with an HR rep. I'm good friends with both my supervisor and manager and failed to go into enough detail on my answers (assuming they already knew what I was talking about)... common mistake, no problem. I knew this coming out of the interview but believed since they asked for a resume, it would also be evaluated and i'd be ok.

Now for my question... They relied solely on those 2 questions and did not evaluate resumes for the position. Is this something common to ask for an updated resume (when i've already qualified for the pool) but then not use it as part of the evaluation process?

My story is literally a first-hand account of exactly what that article is talking about.

Apologies if this comes off as whiny. I'm not really sure what to think and I'm still trying to sort out my feelings of disappointment and annoyance. In November I applied to a GoC position. After many steps in the interview process, I just took a French writing exam and was one point short of the B grade I needed. There is no retest for this ""process"", it seems that's it. Obviously I'm disappointed, but I'm also speechless. The process was so long. So much time and money was spent before a (theoretically cheap) computerised multiple choice test unconditionally disqualified me. I'm sure many of you have already experienced this, but here is a (probably incomplete) list of the things I've done over the past several months:

* Application, cover letter.
* Another portfolio cover letter.
* Fingerprinted.
* RCMP security check.
* Making separate trips to print, sign, and scan many forms: reference release form, security screening release form, others.
* Calling my references. One was unavailable on vacation so they gave me a deadline of just a couple days to get in touch with him.
* Passing an online exam about my area.
* Making a 10-15 minute video of myself answering interview questions.
* French reading test, which I was one point short of scoring exempt.

To arrange all this I exchanged many emails and mail... I'm not sure what to think and I'm a bit speechless. I could use brushing up on my French grammar for formal jobs, but I've worked successfully in 100% francophone companies. Why didn't we do this computerised multiple choice test earlier on? It seems like a lot of my time was wasted and a lot of public funds were spent. I cringe a bit thinking what this means if we scale this up to a national level. Has hiring always been like this? Is this new, or will it change?

Worst of all - I am frankly an utterly excellent candidate for this position and I feel my computer programming skills and degree are desperately needed in government. In my area of expertise typically people are digitally illiterate which is tragic. I'm also a technology educator and want to help people in my field - I feel like this huge edge was worth nothing in the hiring process. I've had two other job offers since November in private industry. I'm not strapped for cash so I turned them down, but processes like this means Canada typically can't hire the best talent because people in demand will easily find better paying positions quicker.

I did not exercise any pension transfer agreement at the time, and that option is no longer available to me. I've been advised that I could still purchase service, and I believe I would have the option of having the MPP transfer funds directly to the PSPP so there would not be any immediate income tax implications.

When /r/CanadaPublicServants was launched at the end of June 2016, there was only 1 moderator (me) and a few hundred subscribers.

Six months later, in December 2016, we had almost 1,000 unique visitors per month, and  almost 13,000 page views per month. I proceeded to recruit two extra moderators in order to assist me in preserving the value of this community. 

In March 2018, the traffic has increased ten-fold since the last time a mod recruitment process was launched. Today, we're seeing almost 12,000 unique visitors per month and more than 185,000 page views per month!

**Today, we are looking for new moderators.**

Moderation here is rare compared to other subreddits, but it does happen every now and then, and it's all done through volunteers. We all have busy lives, families, hobbies beyond Reddit, and none of us can monitor this subreddit 24/7. As our subreddit's visibility increases, we want to increase the likelihood that at least one of us moderators can react promptly if anything is reported and/or found to be particularly problematic on this subreddit (e.g. doxxing, trolling, spamming, etc.).

Therefore, we'd like to have a few extra moderators to help us watch this subreddit, the moderator reports, and take appropriate action if deemed necessary. 

**Are you interested? APPLY HERE:**

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeq1JgUoUQDeXch1R0-MwnG4-RqxCgrOkHnjwt7rbBzZEhTZQ/viewform

**PLEASE APPLY BEFORE  MARCH 20, 2018.**

The application will ask, among a few things, what is your main Reddit account, as we may take a look at your posting history, ask for your department (we would like to have moderators from different departments than existing moderators), and give you a few examples of posts that *may or may not* require action on your part. 

While there is no 100% absolute true answer, and all moderation actions can be reversed across moderators, it helps us gauge your approach to potential conflicts. 

Existing moderators have been, and will be further consulted for the selection process, and only successful candidates will be contacted. 

**Thank you for making this community so great, and good luck!**

PS: The application was only prepared in English because 99% of community submissions on this subreddit are in English, and there's only so much time I'm willing to commit towards this process. That being said, submissions in French on this subreddit have always been welcome.

Lorsque  /r/CanadaPublicServants a été formé en fin juin 2016, il n'y avait qu'un seul modérateur (moi) et quelques centaines d'abonnés. 

Six mois plus tard, en décembre 2016, nous avions près de 1 000 visiteurs uniques par mois, et près de 13,000 pages vues par mois. J'ai alors recruté deux modérateurs supplémentaires pour m'aider à préserver la valeur de cette communauté. 

En mars 2018, le traffit a quasiment été multiplié par dix depuis la dernière fois qu'on a recruté des modérateurs. Aujourd'hui, nous avons près de 12,000 visiteurs uniques par mois et plus de 185,000 pages vues par mois!

**Aujourd'hui, nous sommes à la recherche de nouveaux modérateurs.**

La modération est rare ici en comparaison avec d'autres subreddit, mais elle arrive de temps en temps, et se fait toujours par des bénévoles. Nous avons tous des vies occupées, des familles, des activités au delà de Reddit, et personne d'entre nous ne peut surveiller ce subreddit 24 heures sur 24. Avec la hausse de visibilité de notre subreddit, nous voulons augmenter les chances qu'au moins un d'entre nous modérateurs peut réagir rapidement si quelque chose est signalé et/ou trouvé être particulièrement problématique sur ce subreddit (p. ex. doxxing, trolling, spamming, etc. ) 

C'est pourquoi nous aimerions avoir quelques nouveaux modérateurs pour nous aider à regarder ce subreddit, les rapports de modérateurs, et de prendre les actions adéquates s'il est jugé nécessaire.

Le formulaire vous demandra, entre autres, quel est votre compte Reddit principal, puisque nous allons probablement jeter un coup d'oeuil sur votre historique de soumissions, quel est votre ministère (nous aimerions avoir des modérateurs provenant de ministères différents des modérateurs existants), et vous donnera quelques exemples de soumissions qui auront *peut-être ou pas* besoin d'une intervention de votre part. 

Bien qu'il n'y a pas de réponse 100% absolument correcte, et toute action peut être renversée entre modérateurs, cela nous aide à évaluer votre approche face à des conflits potentiels.

I'm confident interviewing having passed several in a short period of time since my co-op and being bridged into government, and I want to help other students. I want to set up a simple website, develop a simple overview document to sell for cheap, and offer services for anyone who wants help prepping. 


I would think this is fine since I won't be offering any inside information on jobs, just general information that I can apply specifically to their situation that I've been told is really helpful from friends/students who I've helped prep in the past. 


As a package, I could offer to help them practice the government interview answering method (STAR), analyze their job posters and infer what types of questions they can expect, highlight the key things to say and do that have worked for me, and have a prep session over the phone. 


The overview document I might develop is going to talk about my experiences in addition to facts about prepping for interviews. I want to make sure I'm not doing anything wrong if I reference information (not plagiarized of course) that can also be found in the government courses, materials and webpages on this topic (the courses and course materials aren't available to the public though).


I can't guarantee they'll pass (or that they'll even hear back ... government life) but I can guarantee they'll be more prepared. The biggest thing might be that it helps with nerves to talk things through with someone, and being calm and confident is half the battle. 


I joined Reddit tonight to see how often people asked about government interviews to validate if its worth the effort. I got a little distracted in the world of Reddit before I found my way here (lol) after seeing a few interview related questions in this subreddit.

I have never worked in government and I would be grateful for some advice from experienced public servants.

In the fall, I applied for a job in Ottawa. I had a formal interview in January. A few days ago, I had a right-fit interview with a manager. I said I was interested in the job. The manager emailed the next day to say that he thought I was a good fit, and that he'd speak to his HR advisor about the next steps.

This is a good job and I'm genuinely interested. But I'm waiting to hear about a few other jobs (in and out of the public service), some of which are better geographic matches for me and my family. The manager said that no language testing is needed, just reference checks and the security clearance. I envisage no problems with either, but I have been living abroad for the past few years (in a prosperous Western European country, where I've worked only for major employers), so I imagine the security clearance may take a bit longer.

Since I'm waiting to hear from other employers, it would be great if things moved slowly. I have two questions:

I've gone through the processes for both a CS03 CRA position, as well as a CS02 SSC position. Both hiring managers have indicated that LoO's are coming, but, as we all know, nothing is final until the letter is in hand.

For the SSC position, I will be hired at Step-8 of CS02, and this will be a fairly technical role, utilizing my existing skillset (from outside the PS). I would get exposure to other platforms as well, but my primary focus would be a certain technology. The hiring manager is very enthusiastic about my candidacy (I really like the guy, and would want to work for him), and this role seems like a great fit.

But - I had a meeting with CRA this past week regarding a CS03 position. While this is a less-technical role, I will get exposure to new technologies and will get valuable experience in the planning/policy side of IT security. I expect to get Step4 of CS03. This hiring manager is also enthusiastic about hiring me (he also seems like a great manager), but I don't think that this would be a very engaging position for me. Like SSC, however, there will be future opportunities in other areas of the IT security branch

Both positions are indeterminate. For reference, I am an external applicant (never been in PS), NCR, and English-essential.

This should be an easy decision; the CRA position is much closer to home, and has a higher earning potential (right now). As an 'outsider', I've heard the negative comments regarding SSC and their mandate, but I think that I would be much happier working there. Although it is a bit farther (think 15 mins for CRA, half hour for SSC), and I would be at the top of my classification's salary, I would expect there to be CS03 opportunities in the future (who knows when, maybe 2-3 years?). There is, of course, no timeline as to when they would come up, or if I would even be considered as I am not bilingual.

This back-and-forth has been stressing me out, to the point that I'm losing sleep over this. Like any external applicant, I want to ""just get in"", but I want to enjoy what I'm doing. I realize that there is opportunity for movement in the long-term.

Nobody knows. Some departments are quick, some are slow; some people are easy, some are difficult; some trivial cases have weird complications, and some weird cases prove to be trivial. Too many variables for us to give you a helpful answer. Nobody knows.

-----

**I accepted a verbal offer, do I have a job?**

No. A verbal offer means that a manager likes the idea of hiring you. It does not mean you have a job. You do not have a job until you have a Letter of Offer.

-----

**What can I do to make the most of my FSWEP term?**

Learn a lot and get to know people, especially people who aren't on your team. Try to be engaged without being cloyingly energetic: most people want coworkers, not JV cheerleaders.

-----

**What's it like to work at [this department]?**

Nobody knows. Many departments have thousands of employees at dozens of worksites, and the culture and environment can vary widely: even in a small department, often one person's experience will be totally different from that of someone else doing an otherwise-identical job two floors away, so you can imagine how different it can be if one of them is at headquarters and the other is at the branch office in Corner Brook. We can't give you a helpful answer.

-----

**How can I improve my chances of getting hired as external?**

Apply for more.


-----

**My manager is hiring someone to do a job. I think it's unfair, because someone else deserves it more.**

Tough. The only requirements under the Public Service Employment Act is that the manager obtain priority clearance and hire someone capable of doing the job. Beyond that, the manager can consider or refuse to consider anyone they like, for any reason they like, so long as that reason is non-discriminatory. There is no entitlement to be appointed, or considered for appointment.

Even if you're internal. Even if you've been acting in the job. Even if you feel it's your ""turn"". Even if the other candidate is three six-year-olds in a trenchcoat. If those six-year-olds meet the Essential Criteria and fall in the Area of Selection, your manager has every right to hire them.

-----

**Should I take this safe, dull indeterminate job at a lower level, or this risky but fascinating term position at a higher level?**

50% of us will say ""the indeterminate one"", 30% of us will say ""the indeterminate one, you big dummy"", and 20% of us will say ""probably the indeterminate one, but maybe the other one, but *probably* the indeterminate one"".

-----

**The poster says I need [a trait]. I do not have [a trait]. Should I apply anyway?**

No.

-----

**I've got four job offers on the table, which one should I accept?**

All of them. Don't cancel anything until you have a Letter of Offer, and if you decide you like a subsequent offer better, take it instead.

-----

**I'm having trouble with my boss/coworker, what should I do?**

Deploy out, then formally complain if you want to.

-----

**Is the public service as [adjective] as people say it is?**

It's work. It's a lot like other kinds of work. It's also different from other kinds of work. It's work.

-----

**Something bad happened. Should I grieve it?**

Probably not, but you can if you want to.

-----

**I'm a term. How can I improve my odds of making indeterminate?**

Network and apply for other jobs. Your odds of being converted in any given term position are unlikely.

**I'm a casual. How can I improve my odds of making indeterminate?**

Network and apply for other jobs. Your odds of being converted in any given casual position are trivial.

**I'm an agency employee. How can I improve my odds of making indeterminate?**

I'm so sorry.

-----

**I'm in a hiring process and I haven't heard back in a few months, is this normal?**

Yes.



**Should I be worried?**

No. Well, I mean, yes, sort of, but worrying won't help.

-----

**I'm in a hiring process, and I got into the pool. What does this mean?**

It means you may or may not be offered a job at some unknowable point in the vaguely-defined future.

So, basically: it means you don't have a job.

-----

**Do I really need to be bilingual?**

The vast majority of interesting jobs in Ottawa, including virtually every management position above Team Leader, requires at least B/B/B bilingualism.


**How can I improve my French?**

Pay for classes and study. There is no shortcut to learning a language.


**How can I get my manager to approve language training?**

If you have to ask, you probably won't. Language training is slow, expensive, transferable, and often leads to mixed results. Unless your boss is awash with development money (and whose boss is?), you're looking at a tough sell.

-----

**What's the best way to get myself relocated to Ottawa?**

Be the last decent name in a useful pool and encounter a manager so desperate to find someone that eating your relocation is their only option.


**How do I do that?**

Sell your soul to the devil.

-----

**How quickly should I hope to advance?**

God willing and the DRAP don't rise, high-fliers tend to advance roughly one level (EC-3, EC-4, etc.) per two years. This dies down around the EX-minus-2 level, which is when subject-matter expertise begins to give way to broader managerial responsibilities. This represents a chokepoint for policy and operations people in particular: a Unit Manager and a Director General are only two rungs apart on the org chart, but they work in completely different contexts and require radically different skills to succeed.


**How can I become an EX?**

Over the course of a fifteen-year career occupying positions of increasing responsibility, do two years in a big department, two years at Treasury Board or Privy Council, and two years in the regions.

Im new to the fed gov game and will be working in Ottawa at EC-03 for the first year, EC-04 for the second year, and after that I graduate at EC-05. Its an accelerated policy analyst training program. 

EC-03 step one works out to $63,428 annually. Using an income tax calculator  for the province of Ontario, my federal, provincial, and CPP/EI premiums will be about $15,433, leaving an after-tax income of $47,995. 

Now Im very unfamiliar with the extra dues and pension contributions Im going to have to make. What will be my rough net pay once I make those? Im looking for apartments and dont want to overspend based on my after-tax income number.

I am looking for advice on what to do.

I am currently in a junior professional position (XX-02) and have been in this position for almost a year now. Im sort of lost in the position because my current team does not have a lot of extra work and the work that I do have a hand doesnt seem to be very useful in terms of applying for promotions.  So overall I feel underutilized and underdeveloped.  I have expressed this to my manager and director, and there just seems to be nothing for me or they just havent delegated any new work to me. 
Furthermore, there are no promotion/pools open currently for me to apply (probably because its pre-budget.)
With a year or so under my belt I want to start taking steps to applying for a promotion, however there are none available currently. I thought to maybe move laterally to another team/department in hopes to be more fulfilled in terms of interest and skill foundation building but I heard it relatively frowned upon to move at-level especially when I was bridged by my current department. 
So any advice would be appreciated, or maybe I just needed to vent.

I had posted a few weeks back looking for advice on taking the Middle Manager In-Basket:  Exercise 820.  

I took the exercise approximately 3 weeks ago and just got my results back, and someone in the original thread asked me to report back on the results.  I figured I would in case anyone is wondering in the future.

I ended up receiving 26/30.  The PSC's minimum pass mark is 12, but certain processes can set their own minimum pass mark.

My advice:  

* Read through the [description](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/services/staffing-assessment-tools-resources/human-resources-specialists-hiring-managers/human-resources-toolbox/personnel-psychology-centre/consultation-test-services/public-service-commission-tests/middle-manager-basket-exercise-820.html) on the PSC's website.  It really does tell you exactly what they're looking for, and it's a good idea to understand the competencies they are assessing.  
* While writing the test, keep in mind that you **don't** have to get through all of the material, or do all of the tasks by yourself (remember that delegating is one of the competencies)!  
* There is a **TON** of reading material that goes along with the test...background info on the made-up organization, org charts, job descriptions...so much.  Just keep in mind that you need to sort through the relevant information.  
* I scored well on Analyzing, Delegating, Managing Programs, Planning and Organizing...I struggled with Problem Solving (my lowest mark by far).  I believe this was because I focused more on justifying why I was making decisions rather than what the decision actually was.  I also spent a lot of time trying to address every item in my in-basket, so I didn't have time to give a lot of thought to the decisions themselves, and deferred making decisions until I hypothetically had time to learn more about the situation from my staff.  So make sure you spend time on the decisions you are making to ensure that you are solving the problem at hand.
* As someone mentioned in the comments of my original post, make sure that you document every decision you make, every person you contact, any calendar changes, and that you FOLLOW UP.  This exercise really does function like you are working without computers.  Everything needs to be written down.  And following up with people scores you easy points in Delegating, Planning and Organizing.

That's all that I can think of for now but feel free to prompt me for more info!  I hope this is helpful for someone.",True,6,0,,1518753718.0,1518724918.0,2048,,15,0,0

Even as a CS01, I'm given the CS04 acting opportunity to cover off any leave he takes but he won't provide me with an appointment to a recently created CS02 position because ""I couldnt be justified in an appointment because it requires French"" despite the fact that there is literally no change to the actual work being done. I've had a number of people who are shocked when I tell them my substantive level because they naturally assumed that I was at least at a CS03 level.

I'm so happy to have found this sub-reddit, I had no idea it existed until now.  I'm hoping to be part of it for a long time.  That said, my first post is to ask for some advice.

I am due to return to work from short term disability in approximately 8 weeks (not formalized yet, but that is the plan).  I was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer last year, which thankfully (very thankfully) was discovered early enough that they were able to take it out with no issues.  That being said, for preventive purposes, I underwent a few months of chemotherapy and a few surgeries.  The result being that I have been off work for nearly a year.

Now that I'm feeling better, I've begun to review the external job boards as I'm planning on relocating closer to family and would like to find a job located closer to my (new) home.  I didn't expect any interviews or assessments to happen this quickly, but I've been invited to attend a video conference interview before my return to work.  The interview would be with a different area of my department (but they interact a lot).

I'm nervous about this and really could use your advice on the following questions:

1) Would attending an interview, video or otherwise, impact my disability status?  HR would be notified I presume?  I don't want to jeopardize this, though I've heard that people on mat leave have applied to jobs while off (though I know that mat leave and STD are different).


2) Would the fact that I'm still on leave make me unable to accept the interview in the first place?


3) How much do I need to tell them about my reasons for leave/that I'm still on leave, etc.?


4) Realistically, is it even worth it for me to prepare for and attend the interview?  I realize the optics of having been off, though I was a high performer before I left.  Also, I'm definitely not at the top of my game at the moment (and it was an external competition and this area has a reputation for strongly favouring externals). Though if I could be part of a pool for potential pulling at a later time, that would be nice.


5) Any other advice you can think of that I may not have considered.



Thank you so much everyone, I really appreciate your advice!

I am a co-op student looking to complete a second term with the GoC. While I generally enjoyed working on my team last term, I experienced some issues with a supervisor from time to time which were quite challenging 

Basically, this person had a problem with (for lack of a less politically-correct term) being professional: he become openly hostile with me whenever I was unable to deliver what he wanted, exactly how he wanted it (often when there was just not sufficient information to fulfill his request).  One day, he barged into my cubicle to see what the hell I was doing on my computer and then proceeded to launch into a tirade, screaming in my face for a good 15 minutes. He has also referred to female government employees as bitches in the past and often swears at others over the phone. You probably get the picture I experienced a great deal of stress while working under him and it took me a lot of psychological willpower to maintain composure through the end of my term. Given everything, I chose to GTFO and apply elsewhere but Im presently feeling jaded and discouraged about working in the public service b/c I worry something similar might come up in the future. Anyway, while I realize you cant really control for toxic colleagues, Id like to get input on what I could do as a student (or a full-time employee) in the event something like this were to come up again? Would I just have to grin and bear it..? Im not a confrontational person but tolerating this kind of behaviour seems like a recipe for inviting prolonged psychological abuse Anyway, any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I'm planning on applying to this new job, partially for interview experience, partially because I'm ready to move to a new position. If it changes anything, the new job would be in my field and could be considered career development.

I don't intend to give up my indeterminate position (until I find another indeterminate one), but I have seen on this subreddit that you can ask to do the new position as an acting or an assignment. How do you go about doing this? Do you ask the new manager once they've given you an offer? Or during the interview? Are the current managers sometimes hesitate to grant this to employees?

631,7vgoa8,t5_3f8vd,Help calculating my Supplementary Death Benefit deduction,2,explainmypayplease,,,False,False,t3_7vgoa8,False,False,False,"Hi all,

In an effort to calm my frustrations about almost 2 years of pay issues, I am trying to do some calculations for myself regarding one particular pay issue: my supplementary death benefit (SDB).

**Context**

* I am currently [being paid as] an [EC-02 step 2](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=4#tocxx37162)

* From Sept 2016 to Aug 2017 (11 months), due to a Phoenix error, I was not contributing to SDB so I am owing an unknown amount of funds.

*  My SDB deduction (after taxes) per paycheque is $19.29, which seems a little high to me. For instance, my manager, an EC-07, has a bi-weekly deduction of roughly $18.

* I was recently informed that I have an overpayment of $90 related to my SDB. When I asked for an explanation, the pay centre call agent submitted a ticket into TrackMyCASE so that a compensation advisor could call me back and explain this $90. The $90 is too little to cover the 11 months of SDB deductions I did not see on my paycheques.  As we all know, this could take years, so for the moment I have 0 explanation of this mysterious overpayment.

**Calculations**

I have taken some preliminary steps to try and calculate my deduction, based on [this canada.ca page](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/pension-plan/plan-information/survivor-benefits-pension.html). The example provided on the page is as follows:

> Your monthly cost is $0.15 per month for every $1,000 of coverage if you are still employed in the public service. This means that if you earn $52,450 a year, your Supplementary Death Benefit would be equal to $105,000 and you would pay $15.75 a month, or $189.00 a year.

The problem with the example on the above-mentioned page is that it does not specify if the $52,450 is gross pay, net pay, or net pay before ""after-tax"" deductions (which, in my case, are only the SDB and disability insurance).

As such, I have based my calculations on three possible pay scenarios: gross, net, and net pay before after-tax deductions. If based on gross pay, my SDB per pay would be $8.85. If based on net pay before after-tax deductions, my SDB would be $5.74. If based on net pay after all deductions, my SDB would be $5.48.

Line from Canada.Ca|that means that if you earn ___ a year|..Your SDB would be equal to ____,|and you would pay ___ a month[.]|Per paycheque 
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
*Calculation*|*Bi-weekly pay x 26.088*|*Previous column x 2, rounded up to nearest 1000*|*Previous column x 0.00015*|*Assuming a max of twice per month, previous column x 0.5*
**Website example**|52,450|105,000|15.75|7.88
**Scenario 1: My gross pay**|58,817|118,000|17.70|8.85
**Scenario 2: My pay before after-tax deductions (SDB and Disability insurance)** |37,178|75,000|11.48|5.74
**Scenario 3: My net pay**|36,445|73,000|10.95|5.48


Each of these payments comes to less than half of the $19.29 I see every paycheque. My initial reaction is to say that, because I wasn't paying into SDB for 11 months, they automatically doubled my deductions. However, I still seem to owe another $90 on top of that (why didn't they just take the $90 out of my biweekly pay). My union dues, which were also missing for those 11 months, are definitely being doubled because I see them on two separate lines, one of which is labeled ""Dues-Recovery."" 

**TL;DR: My supplementary death benefit calculation seems off. Help me figure out what it should be?**

Since that time, I have had several pay issues for which there are cases open at the Pay Centre and Track my case. 
My pay file is somewhat complex and I understand that given the high volume of transactions at the Pay Centre, it could take a while before a Pay Advisor gets to my file.

A separate issue though is that none of my leave balances have been transferred from my old department. Also, PeopleSoft is not taking into consideration my previous years of service and is only granting me 3 weeks vacation instead of 4. I've submitted a feedback form asking the Pay Centre if it would be possible to adjust my leave while I'm waiting for the rest of my pay issues to be worked out. Is this a reasonable request given that it would probably take a few minutes to update PeopleSoft with my correct credits and adjust my Leave Service Date? Or do I have to wait until someone actually gets to my file? Thankfully, I was smart enough to take a screenshot of my credits before leaving my previous department.

Ive decided to go back to when we were all moved over to Phoenix (May 2016), and calculate my pay and deductions (i.e. gross vs net), and things are going sideways very quickly. 

CIT, CPP, and EI that were deducted from my gross pay are not the same as the calculations I am making based on the rates posted on the CRA website for the 2016 tax year. For example, on one of my pays it appears as though my CIT deduction was calculated at about 12% rather than the stated 15% found in the General Income Tax and Benefit Package for 2016. 

I was wondering if others are experiencing the same issues, or if I am calculating things entirely wrong? Should I even be doing this myself, or should I be going to an accountant?

Applied two weeks ago, had the interview last week and they have already reached out to my references. 

The pay is nothing to write home about and from some research online it seems like the position has a bit of a high turnover rate. I have a couple of family friends who used to be telephone interviewers with Stats Canada (about 5 years ago or so) and both say that upward mobility is tough and lateral opportunities are few and far between. One of them went on to a completely different industry when he realized that this position was going nowhere and another became supervisor (she says she lucked out on getting it).

I'm wondering whether this position is basically a dead end position and to not make much out of it. I graduated from an Honours BA last year and have been contemplating on going back to school or going all in with either the CBSA or a municipal police force. 

Working for the feds is something that's always remained in the back of my mind. I had my sights set on working in my field of study (don't want to disclose too much to give myself away) however after working in that field for a bit, I've been having second thoughts as the work/life balance in awful, the hyper-competitive nature is a turn off and I'm not sure if I want to go back to school for awhile. What interests me about working with the feds is the work/life balance, stability, pension and benefits, and areas of which I have a great interest in (also working in the NCR would be great as that's where I'm from). 

Basically, is this a position with almost zero possibility of upward mobility like my family friends tell me? Will there be any opportunity to network, see some internal postings and maybe one day get off the phones and into a position of interest? Would I have at least a leg up on people with no government experience when applying to various individual positions and pools? I have a feeling that while this is a step up above a dead end retail position, its nothing to get really excited over.

Or requesting any type of leave (appointments, family leave, etc.)?",18,letsmakeart,,,False,False,t3_7rb0ra,False,False,False,"Maybe its because Im young and new to the FT work world (had various FSWEP contracts when in university from 2014-2017, started full-time work in summer 2017) but I seriously feel SO awkward asking for time off, or emailing in to say Im sick. I feel like Im doing something wrong, somehow! I think part of it is that as a student, we didnt have paid time off so I did EVERYTHING I could to avoid missing some hours. I came to work with migraines, a chest infection, a cold that lasted over a month, etc. I switched doctors offices just to have one that gave appointments in the evenings so I wouldnt be stuck with day appointments that would require me to miss work! Now that I have paid leave, I feel so awkward and weird asking for time off for legitimate reasons. Its not like its a constant thing (I think Ive been sick 3 days  not continuous  since last summer. Left 2 hours early once for a dental appointment. Missed an afternoon to attend my university graduation. Requested a vacation day around Christmas.) but I feel like it looks bad or sketchy or somehow fake. Like, Im not gonna haul myself to the Dr and pay $35 for a note saying that yeah, I had a migraine that day when I should just be in bed sleeping it off. 

I also am not sure how much detail to include. I feel like saying Hello (manager), Id like to request (time and date off) because I have a dentist appointment. Let me know if there are any issues and I can see if I can reschedule. Thank you. Just sounds SO FAKE. Or emailing Hello (manager), Im feeling quite sick today so I wont be in. Thank you. also sounds SO FAKE!!!!!! Also because I live fairly close to my office and dont have a long morning routine, Im usually getting out of bed 45-60 mins before Im to be at work So if I wake up with a killer migraine or whatever, it wont be until then that I realize. Again, feels very sketchy to be emailing at 645 when Im supposed to be at work at 730. 

Also recently found out that family leave isnt just for those employees with kiddos, but also anyone who needs to take family (incl parents) to appointments. I used to drive one of my parents to ALL their medical appointments because they dont drive and I was good at listening to the doctors and asking questions and remembering stuff said during appointments. My other parent took over this duty when I started working FT but yeah Id like to be back to doing that (occasionally!) since we have the time off and Im better at it (lol) But I feel so awkward emailing to ask for a day off for that sort of thing???

At my old job, I was part of a very tight-knit group (4 team members) and my supervisor was like a second mom to me. I never felt awkward asking for time off or calling in sick. Sometimes I'd show up to work sick and she'd encourage me to go home because she could tell I was just not having it. The manager I have now is a totally lovely person, but I don't work directly with her very much so 

Can anyone else relate to my neurosis??? Lol. Probably less of a public service employee thing, more just a new young employee thing, but damn.

5. Met with me over lunch to discuss my options and help reach a decision.
6. Reviewed the lease -- and got several concessions from my landlord. (Replace an old appliance, landlord to provide curtain rods, landlord to replace floors, landlord to allow me to hang art without impacting my security deposit...)

I am in need of some advice trying to get bridged into the government. Last year I was working for the government on three FSWEP contracts conssecutively. One full time during the summer and the other two part time throughout the last year of my undergrad while I was finishing my Bachelors of Engineering. Problem was I had problems getting bridged. I did try to talk to my director in bridging me months before graduation but lets just say things did not work out. The manager that helped me obtain my 3 contracts retired right after she gave me my third contract. I emailed alot of managers/directors my last week of work but no one got back to me. 3 months after graduation I was succesfully hired by a private sector company that is under contract with the federal government. We work on federal government projects for the government. The role I am currently in would be the same role I would be doing with the government if I was bridged. That being said I honestly believe the government has more oppurtunity to do amazing work and all sorts of positions for career development. As well the private sector is all about money money money and never about the quality of work like the public sector. But I have learned alot working in the private sector and am more confident in what I am doing. 

I am wondering is there any way of still being able to bridge into the government? I believe i have a year and a half left to be bridged. I have applied internally to inventories such as DND and the post secondary recruitment but am unsure if my application would get pulled since I would be looking for entry level position. As well I am looking to be bridged into an english essential position which makes it harder. Any advice would be helpfull.

Question:

Do you have experience interpreting analyses, defining, and documenting requirements and recommend solutions such as technical documents, procedures, use cases?

My Answer:

Between 04/16 and 11/17, I worked at ____ as a programming analyst where my primary duties included developing applications through _____ and _____. On 05/17 our team switched from _____ to _____ and I was in charge of spearheading the transition. The challenges that I faced included learning the new software, data exporting, and setting up the server. While I was learning the software I had developed small how-to guides are some of the best practices of development and how to develop certain features that were not listed in the official guide. In addition, since the exporting features from the previous software did not exist in the newer one, I had written a program in IBM SPSS syntax that imported the raw dataset from the ______ into a .____ file that is delivered to the client. I had developed a small guide that included screenshots on how to use the program step by step. I've worked with our development team, directors and clients to progress in this transition.

However, based on some research I've done, I'm not sure about certain aspects of this job.

How does the development program (CS-01 to CS-02) work in relation to promotion to CS-02. I've been told that you need to meet certain qualifications at the end of a 2-year period after 2 rotations, but received no indication of what this criteria is. Is this something that is mostly a formality or is there some sort of evaluation for this and what is this criteria?

The promotion process after CS-02 seems a bit uncertain. How difficult is to actually get promoted to CS-03 and how important is French proficiency? I understand that it varies across departments, but most CS-03 jobs seem more management rather than technical and I can imagine it would be very easy to end up in a dead-end situation if you're interested in being promoted but no one pulls you out of a pool (particularly given the sheer number of CS-02s that exist relative to CS-03s and above).

Also, what's the general consensus of the CS culture at Stats Can? I didn't work for very long and only worked for one department, but my general impression was that it was pretty laid back.

Each division is fully self-contained: they run specific facilities or provide specific functions, and don't really interact with each other. Four out of six divisions are located offsite, one in another province.

When I started here (around four months ago), we used a GCDocs Excel spreadsheet as a tasker and tracker: when work goes out, or a deadline is set, it goes into the tracker, and we then update and cross it out accordingly.

The DG is unsatisfied with this solution. In practice, we in the DGO are the only ones who really use it, which means it primarily reflects the transactional stuff which crosses our desks (approvals, submission deadlines, files to review, etc.) instead of the more strategic stuff she wants to know about. And the fact that the divisions basically aren't using it at all (or are only using on a one-way basis, looking up deadlines and docket numbers but not updating it at their end) is apparently unacceptable.

She wants us to come up with a better solution for the new year, and I'm having a lot of trouble moving beyond tinkering at the margins, especially as a lot of the more obvious improvements would make the spreadsheet more difficult to use. (Low-hanging fruit: use Data Validation to standardize certain inputs, especially of dates. But that means getting people to use a standardized date format and expecting them to use filters to pull out the information they need, which is going to piss certain people off...)

At the other extreme, my instinct is to push for us to roll out a software package like Basecamp, which would square a lot of these circles. But apart from the fact that it's not even apparent to me that we'd get approval for Basecamp, that then becomes a new platform (training! growing pains!) for which we'd get zero support from any internal partners (sorry, helpdesk can't help you), and we'd still have the major problem of trying to get the divisions to use the darn thing.

Context:
Last fall I tried my luck with the PSR campaign and managed to get into two pools for EC development programs at different departments. I was also offered a (non-EC) term contract at one of those departments after failing to make it into a separate (non-EC) development program I had applied to through the PSR. I accepted the term position, but three weeks before I started (and before I had been sent a formal contract to sign) I was pulled from the ECDP pool from the other department and offered an indeterminate position, which I accepted. 

Question:
Does the fact that I took a job at a different department affect my status in the other pool I was put in? Do they know I am now employed in the PS and would subsequently not bother pulling me or would they be more inclined to now that I have some real work experience? Also, would they be aware of me bailing on the term contract at their department? It's a very big department, and it was a separate psr process? ",True,6,0,,1513338934.0,1513310134.0,2048,,6,0,0

The post started out fine until they said the following (details removed):

""Unfortunately when I graduated in [Month], [Department] didn't have an existing position in [team] to bridge me into although they had promised it to me and said that they really wanted to. They even had me fill out all the paperwork and had it sent up the ladder. It turned out there wasn't enough budget to make a new position for me which was really upsetting as I'm currently sitting on E.I. and not super happy about it.""

This is oversharing and inappropriate! The first thing that comes to mind from reading this is that: 1) The recent grad is not a strategic planner because they did not set up a backup plan; 2) The recent grad lacks discretion because they are oversharing on a public forum; and 3) The recent grad does not adapt well to negative circumstances.

This could all be untrue, but it's hard to gauge from this post, and first impressions count. So, don't do this! Getting bridged into the public service requires serious perseverance and planning. While I don't consider bridging a gift (because a competent employee worthy of bridging will contribute to the team), it's also not something that students are entitled to. 

If you find that your bridge falls through, bounce back by picking up another job (anything!!!) or volunteering if you can live with your parents for free. While doing this, continue to network with federal contacts and apply to external competitions.

Before I went back to school to finish my degree, I was asked if I wanted to stay, or come back. This sounds naïve, but I never had an occupation in mind so I wanted to serve my country without working in the military, so I wanted work in the public sector. 

 was one of the lucky ones, I was bridged into an indeterminate position, and I dont take this for granted. I know for a fact many people helped me fight for this and put a lot of work in to help me stay. I dont work at a call center, and I work for a management branch.  

Including my time as a student, Ive been working in the public service for a little more than a year now. 

A lot of people have told me, and asked, why I decided to accept the job offer. They consistently tell me to leave while I can because I am, too bright and capable to waste away here.  Theyve said, the benefits and pension are terrible. Nothing is ever insured, nothing for the medical pays 100%, you make peanuts here and there is no room for advancement in pay or position. Other times, they tell me a young hip company with corporate culture would be so much better than the government. Theyve told these things to me this since I was a student, but I was still happy because I love my co-workers, and frankly I hate hassles. 

However, it has gotten to the point where I am doubting my decision. Maybe this is just me venting, but the negativity is making me feel like an idiot. 

So, I thought Id come here and learn about why some of you stayed, or left. Im assuming what my co-workers have told me is true to a large extent, but tell me you experience, or if what Ive been told is overly negative.",True,48,0,,1512314193.0,1512285393.0,2048,,15,0,0

I make a lot for someone my age, but I am unsure of if I should go back to school and pursue a degree.

The main concern for me is, honestly, money. I'm still young, but I do want to have a lot in life. This will sound dumb, but from what I can tell there is more room to earn above-average salaries in the private sector than in the public sector, and that interests me greatly. I know it sounds shallow and all, but in your opinion how likely would it be to make significantly more if I pursued a degree in something like Engineering?

Something that sticks out in my mind is the raw time commitment. A degree is at least four years.. in four years of working at my current salary, that's 200k gross. Even if, in four years, I managed to get a job making 70k vs the 50k I make now, it would take 10 years to make up that 200k ""lifetime earnings boost"" given by working rather than attending an educational institution. That's also assuming that my salary stays the same for the next 4 years at least, and wouldn't improve in those following 4 years either. 

On top of my above example, I would likely end up in debt ~40K for student loans. Which means that I would be looking at at least 12 years to break even, I'll be 35 at that point. I could invest a portion of my earnings for the next 4 years, and it would make it taken even longer to ""break even"" with a degree.

I'm young, and my opinion is skewed. I just read a lot recently about public service jobs having a low ceiling, without much room for significant pay advancement. But I mean, how much can I really earn living in the Atlantic region? Even with a degree, I can't imagine it's much higher than 60-70k without starting a business. And that isn't even a guarantee to work.

     - carry over 196.875

Vacation

     - balance total of 309.375

Im less concerned about sick days, more so my vacation balance. Does this mean my vacation balance is 8 weeks (309.375 / 37.5)? That doesnt seem right to me. Perhaps my first 2 years earned 6 weeks and I have already earned my 3 weeks for year three? I havent taken much vacation but this doesnt seem to add up.

Under the old system we could calculate the pay cheques of 150,000 employees with 1,000 pay advisors. 

Let's assume we hire the very best pay advisors and pay them $100K. That would cost $100M for one year. Figre out how to calculate everyone's pay for less than $100M and you save money over the old system. 

The AG is saying it will cost more than $540M and it won't get done in at least 3 years, but he still doesn't suggest they start over. 

So Unions, here's where you can actually be useful: build calculators for all the damned rules in your own collective agreements and share them with employees. People will be able to verify their own pay cheques. Add them all together and you've got your new pay system. I'm willing to bet it will cost less than $100M.

Or you can keep messing around doing not much and let the government blow more than 5 times that trying to fix something they don't even understand.

I was a casual worker and became a term employee in Sept 2017 (same level i.e. CR-05 casual to CR-05 Term). When I became term, I realize the phoenix system never deducted my deductions (superannuation, death benefit, disability benefit, union dues). I found out that the people never changed my information from a casual to a term, thus generated this ""over payment"" (I'm not sure how else to call it).

It seems that they finally entered the information in and my deductions will roll from future onwards. They told me that my deductions start next week but the system hasn't calculated the overpayment. 

My question is: 
I'm not sure how the payback works: does it take everything as a lump sum?

I'm not sure the exact amount I owe, but how I can I pay as soon as possible?

I was just given an offer via telephone today as a payment services officer in Alberta. I'm really happy about the offer; the pay is respectable and the contract is for 1 year. As a fresh graduate, it allows me to save up some money.

Problem is, I would have to give my current employer my two weeks notice. I told the person who called me about this and they notified me that the training days can't be moved around and that the next training session is going to be held in July so the offer can be pushed to that time. She said people in the qualified pool remain there even if they reject one offer and can be offered a position once more after which they are taken out. 

Thing is I know that if I say no to the offer for now then there is zero guarantees that I will receive a phone call with an offer in July. I thought that Service Canada would be understanding that you can't necessarily drop everything at a moments notice and rearrange everything for their schedule. My employer has been great to me over the last while and I really do not want to burn that bridge. As well, I know that my last two weeks of pay will be withheld if I just bail right now.

Any thoughts on what the odds are of actually receiving a phone call in July and things going smoothly?

As well, assuming things go fine and I start this position hassle free, I'm wondering what the odds are of eventually transferring to another city doing the exact same job? I'm from Ottawa and would love to go back. If I got this job, stuck it out for a couple years, is there a decent chance I could get a transfer?

So my job situation kind of went to crap this week, and I'm wondering if anyone has any insight in terms of how long my situation could take to be resolved, or if it sounds like it's not going to be resolved at all.


So, basically, i'm currently working as a casual and was set to be brought on as an indeterminate employee at the end of my contract. The position was approved for staffing, and we got to the point where the DG was supposed to sign off on funding for the position. The request for this was put in last Monday (April 23), but when things weren't moving along, my HR person inquired as to what was going on and was told that ""all staffing was to be put on a standstill until further notice."" When my boss asked about this, he was told that all staffing in our department is being stopped due to the ""budget for the new fiscal year."" As I understand it, they didn't get as much money as they were expecting to get, and are in the process of trying to get more. My position isn't the only one affected by this standstill, if that matters.


Up until this point, both my boss and the HR person handling my file had been pretty confident that I'd be getting this position. I had even been told that my new start date would probably be sometime next week. Now, they pretty much aren't sure of anything.


So, does this sound like the end of the road for me? Or does it just sound like I'll be starting later on? If so, any ideas on how much later?

Also, I’m exploring some Masters programs that I would hopefully get into for 2019 (MPS, MPPA, MPA) with the goal of networking, getting some placements within government and being exposed to the workings and nuances of government on a theoretical level.

I’d appreciate any comments on what the public service is like, things I need to know and how I could explore different roles (so as to focus my career plans).

this winter/spring. I finished my degree in 2015 but took an extra year in a different subject from 2016-2017 (this means I am bridgeable and I meet all the qualifications for their “box” ).

My manager had a meeting with me half way through my casual contract to tell me he was interested in bringing me into the team. 

However, he recently told my supervisor to tell me that the process will take longer than my casual contract end date.  My supervisor also said there was a priority list involved. 

This part confuses me because: 
1). if I am bridgeable, shouldn’t it be easier to hire me ?  
2). What is a priority list ? How long does this take usually ? 
3). Is that a standard procedure for bringing someone in on an indeterminate basis ? Or on a term basis ? 
4).Why am I being asked to sign a departure form? I know that the letter of offer won’t be finished until after my expiry date, therefore, the departure form makes sense. But,how long is the wait after I leave? Two weeks ? Or 4 months ?

0,8ev6x1,t5_3f8vd,How do we actually make gcconnex useful for collaboration?,19,flyinghippos101,,,False,False,t3_8ev6x1,False,False,False,"During my short time in the public service, I’ve noticed a keen interest by the Government to leverage GCTools to capitalize on social media-lite tools for improving collaboration. I can get behind the principle of this initiative, but what I’m finding (anecdotally and based on convos with colleagues) is that substantive use so far, apart from job postings,
 seems minimal among GC Employees. I argue that part of this problem is its current community of users and the unreconciled tension of having public servants be frank about improving processes.

In my opinion, there seems to be something akin to an unraveling market with respect to the GCConnex community. By this I mean that the majority of frequent users post very similar content on innovation or workplace motivation blogs that appeal to a very narrow segment of the GC Employee user base. For example, the first 10 posts in my “Wire Feed” (excluding job postings) include: 4 on self-motivation/management style links, 2 invites for panel meetings, 2 links to policy articles, 2 one post on “grassroots” innovation vaguely, and only one on improving government processes. Evidently, the discussion typically revolves less on improving processes and more of a buzzword bingo/explosion (look no further than the bewilderingly vague and confusing “OneTeamGov” post on this sub)  and awkward echo-chamber situations where they’re the only people discussing with one another. 

As a result, many of my colleges have self-selected out of using the platform for actual collaboration, which creates a domino effect in which other colleagues opt out of using the platform because of its limited utility as a coordination tool. Hence an unraveling of the platform.

Furthermore, employees hired to promote GCConnex have unintentionally created a sterile, corporate, inorganic atmosphere, which is the antithesis of social media and obviously not conducive to having frank discussions (like this one). Specifically, this raises a more important question about how feasible an honest FB-esque platform is for a GC-endorsed, corporate platform, when Public Servants are above all expected to be ardently loyal to their departments and their ministers.  Just take a look at the “About” GCconnex, which describes it as “a professional social collaboration platform that enables public servants to connect through shared experience, knowledge, groups or interests.” Evidently, there seems to be some conceptual obstacles that the platform needs to transcend to improve.

I’d like to point out that I truly believe that a platform like this would be very beneficial to share best practices, especially for policy practitioners, but it seems to be having a hard time getting off the ground and TBS doesn’t seem to be stepping up. Nor do I want this to seem like I'm undercutting the hard work of gctools employees, or ignore some tangible examples of collaboration coming out of this platform. Just think that there are some very credible limitations standing in the way of it being more accessible and used more appropriately.

My recommedantions:

1.	Curtail significantly the activity of users tied exclusively to promote GCConnex. Let the platform develop on its own merits by the users interested enough to use it; the current model is stunting the developing of a “gcconnex online community.” these employees should be more of an enabling role for users, not just dictate convos

2.	Ensure GCConnex encourages Public Servants to ask uncomfortable questions and have frank conversations about Government Processes and ways to improve them (i.e TBS issue a mission statement for the platform). This will go far in reducing the freeze of frank discussions on the platform

*TL;DR*: GCConnex’s user base is unintentionally preventing its wider adoption of the platform and is conceptually flawed. We should have the platform that’s more organic and user-driven, and have TBS stress the importance of GCconnex as an important public servants discussion forum.

I had some serious medical issues last year (yes, I brought them up to a doctor), in a department which routinely gets too much work (definitely exacerbated the issues). I alerted my manager, but the real solution to my issues would have required my benefits to be active (and they were not, because of a Phoenix issue). I pulled through, but had minor performance issues (I say minor because all of the major job/performance indicia, work products, etc. were met; I worked more than minimum requirements, etc.).

Now my manager wants to put me on an action plan and says I have not met performance objectives as a result of mostly incidents that occurred during the time where I was having medical issues.

0,8eo3ak,t5_3f8vd,Question concerning HR,6,PatrickMB84,,,False,False,t3_8eo3ak,False,False,False,"A couple months ago I was involved in a process for an acting position in my department, same group as mine actually.i wasn't the successful candidate but I felt there was a conflict of interest as part of the process and once i got the email for a postboard I asked the question about what was done to mitigate the conflict, if anything. I requested a follow up to the questions in writing as opposed to a face to face interview as I wasn't too keen on this turning into a he said/she said kind of thing if something went sideways. I got my answer eventually and that was that.

Today, after a few other things popped up I wrote to my manager, who was the hiring manager of the process and just stated my concerns with my position in the group and asked what I could do moving forward to get some much needed supervisory experience/skills within the group. He replied saying my email was lengthy but that he'd like to sit down and talk about it.

I agreed, however asked that someone from the dispute resolution group be present as an unbiased observer as things haven't been so smooth between us since the whole raising the potential conflict of interest. Immediately I received an email back stating that he complied with my request previously (to have a response  in writing) against HRs recommendation and that if I wanted to discuss my email then it would need to be mediated by our senior director. So, a meeting with my manager, senior director and myself was the only way I was having a meeting to discuss my concerns. To be clear here, I never asked for a meeting or a reply to my email. I gladly would have met with him if someone unbiased was also in the room.

My question though, is about the HR comment. It can't honestly be common place for HR to suggest having a face to face conversation over having something in writing. Sure you can pull stuff from an email and make it say a different story but you can always go back and get that string of emails for context and a face to face conversation can easily turn into a he said/she said thing.

So my question is two-fold:
  If I'm qualified and the pool never expires (confirmed by HR), I can still be hired from it, right?

0,8eg9zz,t5_3f8vd,PM01 - never stepped up in income since 2015 - advice on amount underpaid svp.,3,sticktoyourdayjob,,,False,False,t3_8eg9zz,False,False,False,"I just signed on as an indeterminate PM01 after being employed in terms non-stop since 15/10/2015. After reading through my offer I noticed a bit about how I am compensated based on the TBS definitions etc. etc.  So the thought finally struck me to double check to see if my new status involved a pay raise.  

Based on the [TBS](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pubs_pol/hrpubs/coll_agre/rates-taux-eng.asp) I am eligible for pay raises ever 52 weeks (26 pay periods). So I should be receiving PM01, step 3, level D; $55,530.00. But I am only getting 51.5K based on my current pay, that's step-1(level D). *see pay scale below*

Trying to work it out:

** assuming I was paid at Step 1 since I started **

as a term employee you get pay raises every 52 wks or 26 pp, until you are indeterminate. One exception was the Level X restructuring which I do believe was effective 21/06/2016 despite anniversary increments.

** pay table below and [psac payment calendar here](http://psacunion.ca/sites/psac/files/attachments/pdfs/govtcalendar2015-16.pdf)

    Level B pay periods
    15/10/2015 (level B) until 20/06/2016 = 18 pay periods
    $0 net gain, assume they paid me correctly to start.

    Level X Pay periods
    21/06/2016 - 15/10/2016 = 8 pp **level x until first anniversary**
    $0 net gain, assuming again that because this was mandatory that it was implemented properly,
    I think I remember being lucky to be included in this pay bump. Let's assume it was done correctly.

    Level C
    16/10/2016 - 15/10/2017 = 26 pp
    Step 1 pay = $50274k
    Should have been at Step 2 = $52838k
    $2,564 underpaid

    Level D
    16/10/2017 - 15/10/2018 = 26 pp
    Step 1 pay = $50,902
    Should have been paid at step 3 = $55,530
    $4,628 underpaid

    Total underpayment
    $7,192


Am I doing this right? I would really like if someone could give me some advice about this, I am saving for a down payment on my first home and I don't want to count on this money if there's some issue with my calculation or for some reason am illegible for the underpayment.

I may have a promotional offer through a pool qualification from another department, my substantive indeterminate position in my department is an evening shift position.

The offer is for a Monday to Friday day\-time position in another department. The new department may allow me to work from 7am to 3pm, my substantive position is from 4pm to midnight, Sunday to Thursday.

Is it possible to hold two indeterminate positions/are there any complications that could arise?

two weeks later I had a meeting with my supervisor and director and was given a two days noticed of termination. The reasons given were:

* being behind in training 

* and unauthorized days off 

After that was said my director pulled off a bunch of printed emails exchanges I had with other potentials employers and I was told that this should be a lesson how in the public service word gets around.

I was never given any feedback of any kind during my six months here, nor any review of my work. My supervisor and I had an agreement that I could switch my workings days by letting her know the day prior via text or email.

Two days after being fired I was told me they would allow me to finish my contract that runs out at the end of April because firing me would be too much paper work.

The issue I have right now that I have been rejected now for two positions I was considered pretty much hired after the interviews because the unsolicited bad references my supervisor and director have given. I feel I have been blacklisted within my department.

I'm hoping someone can help out here.

*  So I've been told me benefits don't start until after 6 months of employment. I wanted to get a head start on the application process so that I'd be covered ASAP once I was eligible, so I started that on Phoenix. It now shows what plans and things I'm covered under, and the deductions for coverage are coming out of my paycheque, but I don't have any info so I'm confused. I haven't done positive enrolment because I haven't received any information to do so, so I'm wondering why I'm contributing toward benefits NOW if I'm not eligible. Did I bone myself by trying to jump the gun? It also says that dental doesn't require enrolment, so is it just on the same card for the health plan that I'll get (eventually)? And I can just hand this card over to the dentist whenever I go and they go ""yep, ok, you pay 20%""?

* Under the PSHCP summary in Phoenix, it shows what level of benefit plan I am. Trouble is, I can just select I, II or III. The system isn't stopping me, but clearly I'm eligible for only one of them. Where can I find that information? I don't see it in my collective agreement anywhere and the plan directive is not clear on what these levels are and which one I am eligible for. I am reading now that potentially I CHOOSE the level, but I'm assuming higher levels will mean more money? Is there any reason to choose II or III over I?

To be more specific...... how are the employment opportunities for people in the supply chain and procurement sector in the government?

And if you are a daily user of SAP/crossed paths with it how do you find it?

I have gone through the interview process for a term-position, and I only had to submit a transfer of my security clearance (reliability). Unfortunately, after reaching out to them after almost 2 months, they say it has not been approved and that they do not know why. 

**Here is some important background:**

I first got a security clearance through a staffing agency that had contracted me to work for another department (say, Department A) last year. My contract ended with that department, and the staffing agency set me up with another contract in a different department (Department B) that also required a reliability clearance--I assume they handled the transfer of my security clearance. 

Now, recently, when I filed the security-transfer for this term-position (Department C) that is not through a staffing agency I said I had previously completed a Government of Canada Screening Form with Department A/Staffing Agency because they were who I originally did the clearance for.

Some examples:

1. Contractors are not allowed to participate in social activities. No christmas activities; halloween; etc. Attitude is: You are here to do your work and GTFO

2. They don't get many email circulations; Staffing updates, new systems, division wide meetings, etc. When I ask a colleague contractor, hey did you know we are doing a re-org of ABC? He replies, ""oh I'm not even in on those emails!""

3. Contractors often share a cubicle with other contractors and get very minimal supplies; When there's a space issue, its contractors first that will have to move or move in with another.

4. When employees are chatting amongst themselves about private life; it is mostly ok. When contractors chat amongst themselves, they get called out by team leads/employees

5. Disparaging comments like, ""oh you're a contractor, you are making the big bucks! You gotta do the work!""

6. At one of my workplaces, contractors get no ""air time"" with management. Managers and up, they are ""not allowed"" to talk to them. They can only address their team lead/direct supervisor with concerns.


I did the math and it looks like it pays more to be an employee than a contractor. For example: 

Top payscale for CS-02 is $86,200. 

Pension is worth $9,000 on top per year. 

Insurance is worth $3,000. 

Sick/family/personal/vacation is worth:
20 vacation + 6 family + 15 sick days + 2 personal = 43 leave days; 252 working days - 43 = 209 real working days

Indeterminate = Say its worth additional 15% on top of everything for having that job security and cannot be let go at any time.

98,200 * 1.15 = $112,900

$113,000 / 209 = $540 a working day

Most contractor positions are advertised from $450-$550, from many agencies. (I'm not even including the paid training days, work from home benefits for some, and compressed leave benefits aka less commute time)

So yeah, looks like employees get compensated just as well as contractors. Yet contractors are somehow required to work 3-4x more and they get no slack.

It’s been over a year now and I haven’t been paid for some of the hours I worked, I’ve had the previous department where it all started take money away from my new department’s salary without ever discussing anything with me (due to an overpayment Pheonix randomly gave me without actually issuing me any money) and now my T4 is grossly inaccurate. Should I reach out to a lawyer? I’m really not sure what to do anymore. I’ve reached out to the pay center and compensation advisors, and no one has gotten back to me. I’m trying to be patient but after a year of nothing happening, I’m starting to wonder if it’ll ever get resolved. I was told last year that students were supposed to have priority when it came to Pheonix. Also, I’m worried that if I get another job in the government, it’ll just carry on over to that department like it has in the past.

Apparently it was one of the recommendations from the OL report. 

Basically, the PSC is doing a pilot in which hiring managers can conduct their own language assessment of candidates using the assessment method of their choice (what I gathered from reading the hashtag). They record candidates and send the recording to the PSC, but the language experts at PSC don't validate the results, they just listen to recordings for their own internal studies on the pilot. 

Candidates cannot refuse to be assessed by the hiring manager (opting to be assessed by the PSC instead). So, that's kind of annoying for anyone implicated in the pilot. 

Having done a lot of coop interviews where managers tested my French proficiency informally, I can already say this method will probably yield complaints. I had some managers tell me my French proficiency was poor, and others told me it was great. My actual language test with the PSC yielded great results despite no language training, which goes to show how subjective informal language assessments can be. 

I encourage everyone to keep an eye out for the results of this pilot because this could impact hiring and language testing going forward if the PSC deems it ""successful.""

I've done the math on several retirement scenarios, and I'm fairly confident that it makes the most sense for me to transfer my CAF pension to my PS pension, mainly since I'm making a lot more now, but also since it would allow me to reduce the penalty on my pension if I decide to retire before 60.
So, my question is whether I should transfer the pension or cash out my CAF pension and buy back my previous service.
At first I just thought it would be easiest to simply transfer my time, but then I decided to look into the buy back option and the numbers seem to be overwhelmingly in favour of buying back. I feel like I'm missing something here so I'm hopeful that someone can point out the error in my logic. Well, actually, I'm hopeful that I'm right here since it seems like a really good deal :)
My CAF pension statement says that my 5,065 days of service lump sum transfer value is $432k, $200k within tax limits and $232k outside of tax limits. I did a buyback estimate for the time based on my current salary using the CWA pension tool and it came to $138k. This seems to suggest that I could put the $200k into a LIRA until I'm 60, use $138k of the $232k to buyback my CAF service (I believe this is tax deductible), which would leave me with $94k that would be taxed as income (I don't have any more RRSP room).
This seems too good to be true. What am I missing here?

It's only been a few weeks and I can confirm that I have indeed been catfished. This was confirmed by the lady who interviewed me after she noticed my dissatisfaction.. I've been trying to hide it and put my best foot forward but I'm not an Oscar-level actor, I guess. We had a conversation and it basically confirmed all my suspicions.

So friends, take my experience as a cautionary tale about right fit. Some of you cautioned me that it can take a while to get into the groove of a new job. But when you know, you know. I am not the right fit for this team personality-wise or skills-wise. Part of this is my own fault for not investigating the new position more or asking the right questions about the team. 

After wallowing in my misery, I've planned an exit strategy. It doesn't make sense to stay here when I can feel my mental health deteriorating. On the bright side, my old manager is going to a new department in a senior management position and wants me to come along for the ride, so that may be an option too.

Date Posted: 2018-04-03 
To: All staff 
Sent by: Treasury Board Secretariat 


The government is continuing to do everything it can to resolve pay problems and provide as much flexibility as possible for employees experiencing issues with their pay.

To help ensure that the recovery of overpayments related to a Phoenix issue minimizes financial hardship for employees, the government is introducing new measures:
•The recovery of overpayments, emergency salary advances and priority payments related to a Phoenix issue will be managed in the same way. Unless an employee chooses an earlier repayment, recoveries will only start when: ◦all of an employee’s pay problems are addressed, and
◦the employee has received correct pay for three consecutive pay periods.

•Public Services and Procurement Canada will be responsible for managing recoveries for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.
•For employees on leave without pay, recoveries will not start until they return to work.
•Employees will be provided all reasonable flexibility, to decide how they wish to make repayments. This includes delaying repayments until an employee receives monies owed, such as income tax refunds or the receipt of retroactive payments from the implementation of collective agreements.
•If employees consider themselves to be in financial hardship, and have already agreed to a recovery plan before the current measures were put in place, they could ask for their plan to be modified in order to benefit from these new flexibilities.
•Once all of an employee’s pay problems are fixed, the employee will be able to select from a number of options to repay the government, making changes when needed to better suit their situation.

It is important to note that the new measures do not apply to recoveries associated with termination of employment or the end of term or casual contracts that are not extended or renewed.

Details on how these new recovery processes will roll-out across departments and agencies will be finalized in the coming weeks. More information will be shared as it becomes available.

All employees are reminded that information and resources to assist with the Phoenix pay system are available on AgriSource. There are also claims processes in place to compensate employees who have incurred expenses or financial losses because of the implementation of the Phoenix pay system.

The government will continue to take a flexible approach toward addressing the needs of employees, and work in close collaboration with its union partners to minimize the financial impacts on employees due to Phoenix issues.

0,88gyuo,t5_3f8vd,Moving to Ottawa/Gatineau from out of province,6,pubservthrowaway,,,False,False,t3_88gyuo,False,False,False,"Hi everyone.

I will be working in the Little Italyish area soon (Booth St.) soon, sometime within the next few months. Looking for some advice re: Ottawa vs. Hull (Gatineau).

I am relocating from BC and am seriously considering moving to Hull and commuting over a bridge to work every morning. My annual salary will be $63,500, no kids or dependents, single-person household. I'm young and healthy (knock on wood), so I don't require loads of health care services at this moment. I would only live on the QC side for one or two years because my income will be substantially higher in 2020 and financially it would make more sense to live in Ontario. 

Using an income tax calculator, my net income (excluding extraneous work deductions like pension and union fees and the like) in Ontario will be $48,111 off of a gross $63,500. In comparison, if I live in QC, my net income (again, excluding deductions) will be $44,878. I will be making $3,233 more if I choose to live in Ontario. 

But I compared insurance rates too, and I'll be saving $850/yr if I live in QC (I am a new driver from BC so my rates will be $1650/yr in Ontario). I also estimate I'll be saving $300-400/month on a one-bedroom apartment if I live in QC. Thus, even with the higher taxes in QC, I'll still be $3,000 ahead as compared to if I lived in ON. 

What is a realistic commute from Hull to the Little Italy area? I have my own car. Google Maps shows a range between 16 minutes and 35 minutes during rush hour in the morning. Is it usually closer to the latter end of the scale? Will I really be driving 35 minutes to work every morning, or will it be much longer? 

I should add that a main reason for my wanting to move to QC for one year has to do with my BC license conversion. I have the BC equivalent of a G2 and yet Ontario doesn't recognize it as an equal and will force me to take a G2 test and then a G test. *I hate taking road tests with a burning, fiery passion.* I would do anything to avoid it. I have more than two years of (clean) driving experience and QC will give me a full license right away. Thus, not only will I be keeping $3,000 more of my money (per year) if I lived in QC, but I don't have to take another two road tests. Thank God. 

My main concerns regarding living in Hull has to do with the commute in the morning. I can handle a half-hour commute... it's just if it's one hour every morning, I'd really have to reconsider. I've grown up and lived in the ""ghettos"" of the Vancouver Lower Mainland, so I really don't mind that Hull is known for being grungy and dirty. 

Would love some advice/other considerations.

Thank you for reading my long-winded post.

I wanted to ask you all if there is any downside to having a short break in employment between an FSWEP and indeterminate status? (e.g. for pension purposes, etc.)

I have been working in the federal government for co-op semesters full-time and FSWEP part-time during school semesters for 3 years now with no break in employment (this is by chance, I didn't purposely have a reason to not have a break in employment; and it was done all with the same employer). 

I will be bridged (through non-advertised, not student bridging) 30 days after my last FSWEP contract expires. This works out really well for me as within those 30 days I will have numerous exams for school and it will give me some downtime for more studying. However, my manager has offered to sign me to an FSWEP part-time contract for those 30 days now so I can keep working uninterrupted, if I want. 

Is there any benefit (other than obviously the salary for the few days worked within those 30 days) for me to sign an extension for those 30 days? Perhaps for pension buyback purposes? Without any additional benefit, it is tempting to not extend as I would likely need to take LWOP for a bunch of exams during that period anyway.

I apologize if this has already been asked, I tried using Reddit search and haven't found any threads about this.

I recently started working on the new team and they have me doing menial tasks a student with could do.

So I'll have to visit them again. In the interview, they told me that they are creating an inventory of qualified candidates which experts can later access for candidates of their choice. Potential candidates may be called for a brief conversation with these experts at a later date. As of now, I have no idea what will happen and when (if at all) after they finish the security check and reference check. 

I was wondering if there is a chance that I went through this entire process for nothing. It seems a little aggressive for creating an inventory. I may be wrong. Is it always like this? Thanks for your time.",True,2,0,,1521522498.0,1521493698.0,2048,,2,0,0

Is it a conflict of interest if I leave the casual contract sooner to work with this other department?

Backstory: I am currently an AS-03. Last year i got into a partially assessed AS-04 and AS-05 pool. In February I was sent an email as part of an opportunity coming from the pool. In that email they asked 4 specific questions (overtime, travel, etc.) nothing too crazy but they also asked for an updated resume. I answered all 4 questions and provided my updated resume.

Now comes the interview.  They only had 2 questions that werent already assessed in the pool. I came in second (of 4) apparently and knew my issue before they told me. I was interviewing with my manager and another supervisor in our group along with an HR rep. I'm good friends with both my supervisor and manager and failed to go into enough detail on my answers (assuming they already knew what I was talking about)... common mistake, no problem. I knew this coming out of the interview but believed since they asked for a resume, it would also be evaluated and i'd be ok.

Now for my question... They relied solely on those 2 questions and did not evaluate resumes for the position. Is this something common to ask for an updated resume (when i've already qualified for the pool) but then not use it as part of the evaluation process?

Sorry for the wall of text, just a little exasperated at this point.

My story is literally a first-hand account of exactly what that article is talking about.

Apologies if this comes off as whiny. I'm not really sure what to think and I'm still trying to sort out my feelings of disappointment and annoyance. In November I applied to a GoC position. After many steps in the interview process, I just took a French writing exam and was one point short of the B grade I needed. There is no retest for this ""process"", it seems that's it. Obviously I'm disappointed, but I'm also speechless. The process was so long. So much time and money was spent before a (theoretically cheap) computerised multiple choice test unconditionally disqualified me. I'm sure many of you have already experienced this, but here is a (probably incomplete) list of the things I've done over the past several months:

* Application, cover letter.
* Another portfolio cover letter.
* Fingerprinted.
* RCMP security check.
* Making separate trips to print, sign, and scan many forms: reference release form, security screening release form, others.
* Calling my references. One was unavailable on vacation so they gave me a deadline of just a couple days to get in touch with him.
* Passing an online exam about my area.
* Making a 10-15 minute video of myself answering interview questions.
* French reading test, which I was one point short of scoring exempt.

To arrange all this I exchanged many emails and mail... I'm not sure what to think and I'm a bit speechless. I could use brushing up on my French grammar for formal jobs, but I've worked successfully in 100% francophone companies. Why didn't we do this computerised multiple choice test earlier on? It seems like a lot of my time was wasted and a lot of public funds were spent. I cringe a bit thinking what this means if we scale this up to a national level. Has hiring always been like this? Is this new, or will it change?

Worst of all - I am frankly an utterly excellent candidate for this position and I feel my computer programming skills and degree are desperately needed in government. In my area of expertise typically people are digitally illiterate which is tragic. I'm also a technology educator and want to help people in my field - I feel like this huge edge was worth nothing in the hiring process. I've had two other job offers since November in private industry. I'm not strapped for cash so I turned them down, but processes like this means Canada typically can't hire the best talent because people in demand will easily find better paying positions quicker.

I'm probably going to keep trying for GoC positions so I'm happy to hear your thoughts.

When /r/CanadaPublicServants was launched at the end of June 2016, there was only 1 moderator (me) and a few hundred subscribers.

Six months later, in December 2016, we had almost 1,000 unique visitors per month, and  almost 13,000 page views per month. I proceeded to recruit two extra moderators in order to assist me in preserving the value of this community. 

In March 2018, the traffic has increased ten-fold since the last time a mod recruitment process was launched. Today, we're seeing almost 12,000 unique visitors per month and more than 185,000 page views per month!

**Today, we are looking for new moderators.**

Moderation here is rare compared to other subreddits, but it does happen every now and then, and it's all done through volunteers. We all have busy lives, families, hobbies beyond Reddit, and none of us can monitor this subreddit 24/7. As our subreddit's visibility increases, we want to increase the likelihood that at least one of us moderators can react promptly if anything is reported and/or found to be particularly problematic on this subreddit (e.g. doxxing, trolling, spamming, etc.).

Therefore, we'd like to have a few extra moderators to help us watch this subreddit, the moderator reports, and take appropriate action if deemed necessary. 

**Are you interested? APPLY HERE:**

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeq1JgUoUQDeXch1R0-MwnG4-RqxCgrOkHnjwt7rbBzZEhTZQ/viewform

**PLEASE APPLY BEFORE  MARCH 20, 2018.**

The application will ask, among a few things, what is your main Reddit account, as we may take a look at your posting history, ask for your department (we would like to have moderators from different departments than existing moderators), and give you a few examples of posts that *may or may not* require action on your part. 

While there is no 100% absolute true answer, and all moderation actions can be reversed across moderators, it helps us gauge your approach to potential conflicts. 

Existing moderators have been, and will be further consulted for the selection process, and only successful candidates will be contacted. 

**Thank you for making this community so great, and good luck!**

PS: The application was only prepared in English because 99% of community submissions on this subreddit are in English, and there's only so much time I'm willing to commit towards this process. That being said, submissions in French on this subreddit have always been welcome.

**Un peu d'histoire :**

Lorsque  /r/CanadaPublicServants a été formé en fin juin 2016, il n'y avait qu'un seul modérateur (moi) et quelques centaines d'abonnés. 

Six mois plus tard, en décembre 2016, nous avions près de 1 000 visiteurs uniques par mois, et près de 13,000 pages vues par mois. J'ai alors recruté deux modérateurs supplémentaires pour m'aider à préserver la valeur de cette communauté. 

En mars 2018, le traffit a quasiment été multiplié par dix depuis la dernière fois qu'on a recruté des modérateurs. Aujourd'hui, nous avons près de 12,000 visiteurs uniques par mois et plus de 185,000 pages vues par mois!

**Aujourd'hui, nous sommes à la recherche de nouveaux modérateurs.**

La modération est rare ici en comparaison avec d'autres subreddit, mais elle arrive de temps en temps, et se fait toujours par des bénévoles. Nous avons tous des vies occupées, des familles, des activités au delà de Reddit, et personne d'entre nous ne peut surveiller ce subreddit 24 heures sur 24. Avec la hausse de visibilité de notre subreddit, nous voulons augmenter les chances qu'au moins un d'entre nous modérateurs peut réagir rapidement si quelque chose est signalé et/ou trouvé être particulièrement problématique sur ce subreddit (p. ex. doxxing, trolling, spamming, etc. ) 

C'est pourquoi nous aimerions avoir quelques nouveaux modérateurs pour nous aider à regarder ce subreddit, les rapports de modérateurs, et de prendre les actions adéquates s'il est jugé nécessaire. 

**Cela vous intéresse? POSTULEZ ICI:**

**VEUILLEZ POSTULER AVANT LE 20 MARS 2018.**

Le formulaire vous demandra, entre autres, quel est votre compte Reddit principal, puisque nous allons probablement jeter un coup d'oeuil sur votre historique de soumissions, quel est votre ministère (nous aimerions avoir des modérateurs provenant de ministères différents des modérateurs existants), et vous donnera quelques exemples de soumissions qui auront *peut-être ou pas* besoin d'une intervention de votre part. 

Bien qu'il n'y a pas de réponse 100% absolument correcte, et toute action peut être renversée entre modérateurs, cela nous aide à évaluer votre approche face à des conflits potentiels. 

Les modérateurs existants ont été, et seront consultés à nouveau pour le processus de sélection, et seulement les candidats choisis seront contactés. 

**Merci de rendre cette communauté si formidable, et bonne chance!**

I want to set up a simple website, develop a simple overview document to sell for cheap, and offer services for anyone who wants help prepping. 


I would think this is fine since I won't be offering any inside information on jobs, just general information that I can apply specifically to their situation that I've been told is really helpful from friends/students who I've helped prep in the past. 


As a package, I could offer to help them practice the government interview answering method (STAR), analyze their job posters and infer what types of questions they can expect, highlight the key things to say and do that have worked for me, and have a prep session over the phone. 


The overview document I might develop is going to talk about my experiences in addition to facts about prepping for interviews. I want to make sure I'm not doing anything wrong if I reference information (not plagiarized of course) that can also be found in the government courses, materials and webpages on this topic (the courses and course materials aren't available to the public though).


I can't guarantee they'll pass (or that they'll even hear back ... government life) but I can guarantee they'll be more prepared. The biggest thing might be that it helps with nerves to talk things through with someone, and being calm and confident is half the battle. 


I joined Reddit tonight to see how often people asked about government interviews to validate if its worth the effort. I got a little distracted in the world of Reddit before I found my way here (lol) after seeing a few interview related questions in this subreddit.

I have never worked in government and I would be grateful for some advice from experienced public servants.

In the fall, I applied for a job in Ottawa. I had a formal interview in January. A few days ago, I had a right-fit interview with a manager. I said I was interested in the job. The manager emailed the next day to say that he thought I was a good fit, and that he'd speak to his HR advisor about the next steps.

This is a good job and I'm genuinely interested. But I'm waiting to hear about a few other jobs (in and out of the public service), some of which are better geographic matches for me and my family. The manager said that no language testing is needed, just reference checks and the security clearance. I envisage no problems with either, but I have been living abroad for the past few years (in a prosperous Western European country, where I've worked only for major employers), so I imagine the security clearance may take a bit longer.

Since I'm waiting to hear from other employers, it would be great if things moved slowly. I have two questions:

(1) How long do you think I have before a letter of offer arrives?
(2) Once I get a letter of offer, how long will I have to consider the offer and make a decision?

I've gone through the processes for both a CS03 CRA position, as well as a CS02 SSC position. Both hiring managers have indicated that LoO's are coming, but, as we all know, nothing is final until the letter is in hand.

For the SSC position, I will be hired at Step-8 of CS02, and this will be a fairly technical role, utilizing my existing skillset (from outside the PS). I would get exposure to other platforms as well, but my primary focus would be a certain technology. The hiring manager is very enthusiastic about my candidacy (I really like the guy, and would want to work for him), and this role seems like a great fit.

But - I had a meeting with CRA this past week regarding a CS03 position. While this is a less-technical role, I will get exposure to new technologies and will get valuable experience in the planning/policy side of IT security. I expect to get Step4 of CS03. This hiring manager is also enthusiastic about hiring me (he also seems like a great manager), but I don't think that this would be a very engaging position for me. Like SSC, however, there will be future opportunities in other areas of the IT security branch

Both positions are indeterminate. For reference, I am an external applicant (never been in PS), NCR, and English-essential.

This should be an easy decision; the CRA position is much closer to home, and has a higher earning potential (right now). As an 'outsider', I've heard the negative comments regarding SSC and their mandate, but I think that I would be much happier working there. Although it is a bit farther (think 15 mins for CRA, half hour for SSC), and I would be at the top of my classification's salary, I would expect there to be CS03 opportunities in the future (who knows when, maybe 2-3 years?). There is, of course, no timeline as to when they would come up, or if I would even be considered as I am not bilingual.

This back-and-forth has been stressing me out, to the point that I'm losing sleep over this. Like any external applicant, I want to ""just get in"", but I want to enjoy what I'm doing. I realize that there is opportunity for movement in the long-term.

TL;DR: for any IT professionals (security or otherwise) out there, which organization would you prefer to join and why? if anyone can provide experiences at either CRA or SSC, it would be much appreciated.",True,35,0,,1520138515.0,1520109715.0,2048,,14,0,0

Nobody knows. Some departments are quick, some are slow; some people are easy, some are difficult; some trivial cases have weird complications, and some weird cases prove to be trivial. Too many variables for us to give you a helpful answer. Nobody knows.

-----

**I accepted a verbal offer, do I have a job?**

No. A verbal offer means that a manager likes the idea of hiring you. It does not mean you have a job. You do not have a job until you have a Letter of Offer.

-----

**What can I do to make the most of my FSWEP term?**

Learn a lot and get to know people, especially people who aren't on your team. Try to be engaged without being cloyingly energetic: most people want coworkers, not JV cheerleaders.

-----

**What's it like to work at [this department]?**

Nobody knows. Many departments have thousands of employees at dozens of worksites, and the culture and environment can vary widely: even in a small department, often one person's experience will be totally different from that of someone else doing an otherwise-identical job two floors away, so you can imagine how different it can be if one of them is at headquarters and the other is at the branch office in Corner Brook. We can't give you a helpful answer.

-----

**How can I improve my chances of getting hired as external?**

Apply for more.


-----

**My manager is hiring someone to do a job. I think it's unfair, because someone else deserves it more.**

Tough. The only requirements under the Public Service Employment Act is that the manager obtain priority clearance and hire someone capable of doing the job. Beyond that, the manager can consider or refuse to consider anyone they like, for any reason they like, so long as that reason is non-discriminatory. There is no entitlement to be appointed, or considered for appointment.

Even if you're internal. Even if you've been acting in the job. Even if you feel it's your ""turn"". Even if the other candidate is three six-year-olds in a trenchcoat. If those six-year-olds meet the Essential Criteria and fall in the Area of Selection, your manager has every right to hire them.

-----

**Should I take this safe, dull indeterminate job at a lower level, or this risky but fascinating term position at a higher level?**

50% of us will say ""the indeterminate one"", 30% of us will say ""the indeterminate one, you big dummy"", and 20% of us will say ""probably the indeterminate one, but maybe the other one, but *probably* the indeterminate one"".

-----

**The poster says I need [a trait]. I do not have [a trait]. Should I apply anyway?**

No.

-----

**I've got four job offers on the table, which one should I accept?**

All of them. Don't cancel anything until you have a Letter of Offer, and if you decide you like a subsequent offer better, take it instead.

-----

**I'm having trouble with my boss/coworker, what should I do?**

Deploy out, then formally complain if you want to.

-----

**Is the public service as [adjective] as people say it is?**

It's work. It's a lot like other kinds of work. It's also different from other kinds of work. It's work.

-----

**Something bad happened. Should I grieve it?**

Probably not, but you can if you want to.

-----

**I'm a term. How can I improve my odds of making indeterminate?**

Network and apply for other jobs. Your odds of being converted in any given term position are unlikely.

**I'm a casual. How can I improve my odds of making indeterminate?**

Network and apply for other jobs. Your odds of being converted in any given casual position are trivial.

**I'm an agency employee. How can I improve my odds of making indeterminate?**

I'm so sorry.

-----

**I'm in a hiring process and I haven't heard back in a few months, is this normal?**

Yes.



**Should I be worried?**

No. Well, I mean, yes, sort of, but worrying won't help.

-----

**I'm in a hiring process, and I got into the pool. What does this mean?**

It means you may or may not be offered a job at some unknowable point in the vaguely-defined future.

So, basically: it means you don't have a job.

-----

**Do I really need to be bilingual?**

The vast majority of interesting jobs in Ottawa, including virtually every management position above Team Leader, requires at least B/B/B bilingualism.


**How can I improve my French?**

Pay for classes and study. There is no shortcut to learning a language.


**How can I get my manager to approve language training?**

If you have to ask, you probably won't. Language training is slow, expensive, transferable, and often leads to mixed results. Unless your boss is awash with development money (and whose boss is?), you're looking at a tough sell.

-----

**What's the best way to get myself relocated to Ottawa?**

Be the last decent name in a useful pool and encounter a manager so desperate to find someone that eating your relocation is their only option.


**How do I do that?**

Sell your soul to the devil.

-----

**How quickly should I hope to advance?**

God willing and the DRAP don't rise, high-fliers tend to advance roughly one level (EC-3, EC-4, etc.) per two years. This dies down around the EX-minus-2 level, which is when subject-matter expertise begins to give way to broader managerial responsibilities. This represents a chokepoint for policy and operations people in particular: a Unit Manager and a Director General are only two rungs apart on the org chart, but they work in completely different contexts and require radically different skills to succeed.


**How can I become an EX?**

Over the course of a fifteen-year career occupying positions of increasing responsibility, do two years in a big department, two years at Treasury Board or Privy Council, and two years in the regions. Score a law degree or an MBA. Get your C/C/C or better. Win a bunch of awards. Do interdepartmental stuff. Dress like you belong.

I am looking for advice on what to do.

I am currently in a junior professional position (XX-02) and have been in this position for almost a year now. I’m sort of lost in the position because my current team does not have a lot of extra work and the work that I do have a hand doesn’t seem to be very useful in terms of applying for promotions.  So overall I feel underutilized and underdeveloped.  I have expressed this to my manager and director, and there just seems to be nothing for me or they just haven’t delegated any new work to me. 
Furthermore, there are no promotion/pools open currently for me to apply (probably because its pre-budget.)
With a year or so under my belt I want to start taking steps to applying for a promotion, however there are none available currently. I thought to maybe move laterally to another team/department in hopes to be more fulfilled in terms of interest and skill foundation building but I heard it relatively frowned upon to move at-level especially when I was bridged by my current department. 
So any advice would be appreciated, or maybe I just needed to vent.

The original posting said the ""immediate need"" was for one indeterminate candidate, and a ""pool of qualified candidates may be created"" to staff for similar positions, with various tenures, etc.

I have already gone through some testing and an interview about five weeks ago, and last week I was contacted to send proof of education.  Anyway, I just received an email saying I was ""found qualified"" and was ""placed in a pool of qualified candidates.""  Furthermore, that ""once the decision regarding the selection of candidates from the pool is made"" that I would be ""notified of the results,"" and would be contacted for an ""informal discussion.""

So if I understand it correctly, the position they posted for was filled and I am now in this pool.  Is that correct?  Or has the decision about the ""immediate need"" not been made yet?

I had posted a few weeks back looking for advice on taking the Middle Manager In-Basket:  Exercise 820.  

I took the exercise approximately 3 weeks ago and just got my results back, and someone in the original thread asked me to report back on the results.  I figured I would in case anyone is wondering in the future.

I ended up receiving 26/30.  The PSC's minimum pass mark is 12, but certain processes can set their own minimum pass mark.

My advice:  

* Read through the [description](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/services/staffing-assessment-tools-resources/human-resources-specialists-hiring-managers/human-resources-toolbox/personnel-psychology-centre/consultation-test-services/public-service-commission-tests/middle-manager-basket-exercise-820.html) on the PSC's website.  It really does tell you exactly what they're looking for, and it's a good idea to understand the competencies they are assessing.  
* While writing the test, keep in mind that you **don't** have to get through all of the material, or do all of the tasks by yourself (remember that delegating is one of the competencies)!  
* There is a **TON** of reading material that goes along with the test...background info on the made-up organization, org charts, job descriptions...so much.  Just keep in mind that you need to sort through the relevant information.  
* I scored well on Analyzing, Delegating, Managing Programs, Planning and Organizing...I struggled with Problem Solving (my lowest mark by far).  I believe this was because I focused more on justifying why I was making decisions rather than what the decision actually was.  I also spent a lot of time trying to address every item in my in-basket, so I didn't have time to give a lot of thought to the decisions themselves, and deferred making decisions until I hypothetically had time to learn more about the situation from my staff.  So make sure you spend time on the decisions you are making to ensure that you are solving the problem at hand.
* As someone mentioned in the comments of my original post, make sure that you document every decision you make, every person you contact, any calendar changes, and that you FOLLOW UP.  This exercise really does function like you are working without computers.  Everything needs to be written down.  And following up with people scores you easy points in Delegating, Planning and Organizing.

That's all that I can think of for now but feel free to prompt me for more info!  I hope this is helpful for someone.",True,6,0,,1518753718.0,1518724918.0,2048,,13,0,0

Even as a CS01, I'm given the CS04 acting opportunity to cover off any leave he takes but he won't provide me with an appointment to a recently created CS02 position because ""I couldnt be justified in an appointment because it requires French"" despite the fact that there is literally no change to the actual work being done.

Now that I'm feeling better, I've begun to review the external job boards as I'm planning on relocating closer to family and would like to find a job located closer to my (new) home.  I didn't expect any interviews or assessments to happen this quickly, but I've been invited to attend a video conference interview before my return to work.  The interview would be with a different area of my department (but they interact a lot).

I'm nervous about this and really could use your advice on the following questions:

1) Would attending an interview, video or otherwise, impact my disability status?  HR would be notified I presume?  I don't want to jeopardize this, though I've heard that people on mat leave have applied to jobs while off (though I know that mat leave and STD are different).


2) Would the fact that I'm still on leave make me unable to accept the interview in the first place?


3) How much do I need to tell them about my reasons for leave/that I'm still on leave, etc.?


4) Realistically, is it even worth it for me to prepare for and attend the interview?  I realize the optics of having been off, though I was a high performer before I left.  Also, I'm definitely not at the top of my game at the moment (and it was an external competition and this area has a reputation for strongly favouring externals). Though if I could be part of a pool for potential pulling at a later time, that would be nice.


5) Any other advice you can think of that I may not have considered.



Thank you so much everyone, I really appreciate your advice!

I am a co-op student looking to complete a second term with the GoC. While I generally enjoyed working on my team last term, I experienced some issues with a supervisor from time to time which were quite challenging… 

Basically, this person had a problem with (for lack of a less politically-correct term) being professional: he become openly hostile with me whenever I was unable to deliver what he wanted, exactly how he wanted it (often when there was just not sufficient information to fulfill his request).  One day, he barged into my cubicle to “see what the hell I was doing on my computer” and then proceeded to launch into a tirade, screaming in my face for a good 15 minutes. He has also referred to female government employees as “bitches” in the past and often swears at others over the phone. You probably get the picture… I experienced a great deal of stress while working under him and it took me a lot of psychological willpower to maintain composure through the end of my term. Given everything, I chose to GTFO and apply elsewhere but I’m presently feeling jaded and discouraged about working in the public service b/c I worry something similar might come up in the future. Anyway, while I realize you can’t really control for toxic colleagues, I’d like to get input on what I could do as a student (or a full-time employee) in the event something like this were to come up again? Would I just have to grin and bear it..? I’m not a confrontational person but tolerating this kind of behaviour seems like a recipe for inviting prolonged psychological abuse… Anyway, any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I'm in a dilemma where I have the option to return home to the NCR in the exact same position (deployment) that I have here (won't name). I've spent the whole weekend now thinking hard on it as a reply needs to be sent tomorrow.

I started out here on a term (which has already been extended) and have met amazing new friends, co-workers, management staff, and have been given opportunities (training for acting) others have said would have happened after years of service and even that would have been a ""maybe"". I've been here and in the PS less than half a year. I don't think a unilingual like me will have the same sort of success or progress in Gatineau.

Having been given this opportunity to return home is all great but I'm having second thoughts due to all the support I've received here. It's kind of hurting my personal loyalty values just thinking about it. But then there's also posts everywhere about how hard it is to get your foot back into the NCR once you leave it to go elsewhere and it makes me wonder if I'm tossing away some good luck.

0,7vgoa8,t5_3f8vd,Help calculating my Supplementary Death Benefit deduction,2,explainmypayplease,,,False,False,t3_7vgoa8,False,False,False,"Hi all,

In an effort to calm my frustrations about almost 2 years of pay issues, I am trying to do some calculations for myself regarding one particular pay issue: my supplementary death benefit (SDB).

**Context**

* I am currently [being paid as] an [EC-02 step 2](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=4#tocxx37162)

* From Sept 2016 to Aug 2017 (11 months), due to a Phoenix error, I was not contributing to SDB so I am owing an unknown amount of funds.

*  My SDB deduction (after taxes) per paycheque is $19.29, which seems a little high to me. For instance, my manager, an EC-07, has a bi-weekly deduction of roughly $18.

* I was recently informed that I have an overpayment of $90 related to my SDB. When I asked for an explanation, the pay centre call agent submitted a ticket into TrackMyCASE so that a compensation advisor could call me back and explain this $90. The $90 is too little to cover the 11 months of SDB deductions I did not see on my paycheques.  As we all know, this could take years, so for the moment I have 0 explanation of this mysterious overpayment.

**Calculations**

I have taken some preliminary steps to try and calculate my deduction, based on [this canada.ca page](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/pension-plan/plan-information/survivor-benefits-pension.html). The example provided on the page is as follows:

> Your monthly cost is $0.15 per month for every $1,000 of coverage if you are still employed in the public service. This means that if you earn $52,450 a year, your Supplementary Death Benefit would be equal to $105,000 and you would pay $15.75 a month, or $189.00 a year.

The problem with the example on the above-mentioned page is that it does not specify if the $52,450 is gross pay, net pay, or net pay before ""after-tax"" deductions (which, in my case, are only the SDB and disability insurance).

As such, I have based my calculations on three possible pay scenarios: gross, net, and net pay before after-tax deductions. If based on gross pay, my SDB per pay would be $8.85. If based on net pay before after-tax deductions, my SDB would be $5.74. If based on net pay after all deductions, my SDB would be $5.48.

Line from Canada.Ca|“…that means that if you earn ___ a year…”|..”Your SDB would be equal to ____,”|“…and you would pay ___ a month[.]”|Per paycheque 
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
*Calculation*|*Bi-weekly pay x 26.088*|*Previous column x 2, rounded up to nearest 1000*|*Previous column x 0.00015*|*Assuming a max of twice per month, previous column x 0.5*
**Website example**|52,450|105,000|15.75|7.88
**Scenario 1: My gross pay**|58,817|118,000|17.70|8.85
**Scenario 2: My pay before “after-tax” deductions (SDB and Disability insurance)** |37,178|75,000|11.48|5.74
**Scenario 3: My net pay**|36,445|73,000|10.95|5.48


Each of these payments comes to less than half of the $19.29 I see every paycheque. My initial reaction is to say that, because I wasn't paying into SDB for 11 months, they automatically doubled my deductions. However, I still seem to owe another $90 on top of that (why didn't they just take the $90 out of my biweekly pay). My union dues, which were also missing for those 11 months, are definitely being doubled because I see them on two separate lines, one of which is labeled ""Dues-Recovery."" 

**TL;DR: My supplementary death benefit calculation seems off. Help me figure out what it should be?**

Applied two weeks ago, had the interview last week and they have already reached out to my references. 

The pay is nothing to write home about and from some research online it seems like the position has a bit of a high turnover rate. I have a couple of family friends who used to be telephone interviewers with Stats Canada (about 5 years ago or so) and both say that upward mobility is tough and lateral opportunities are few and far between. One of them went on to a completely different industry when he realized that this position was going nowhere and another became supervisor (she says she lucked out on getting it).

I'm wondering whether this position is basically a dead end position and to not make much out of it. I graduated from an Honours BA last year and have been contemplating on going back to school or going all in with either the CBSA or a municipal police force. 

Working for the feds is something that's always remained in the back of my mind. I had my sights set on working in my field of study (don't want to disclose too much to give myself away) however after working in that field for a bit, I've been having second thoughts as the work/life balance in awful, the hyper-competitive nature is a turn off and I'm not sure if I want to go back to school for awhile. What interests me about working with the feds is the work/life balance, stability, pension and benefits, and areas of which I have a great interest in (also working in the NCR would be great as that's where I'm from). 

Basically, is this a position with almost zero possibility of upward mobility like my family friends tell me? Will there be any opportunity to network, see some internal postings and maybe one day get off the phones and into a position of interest? Would I have at least a leg up on people with no government experience when applying to various individual positions and pools? I have a feeling that while this is a step up above a dead end retail position, its nothing to get really excited over.

I feel like I’m doing something wrong, somehow! I think part of it is that as a student, we didn’t have paid time off so I did EVERYTHING I could to avoid missing some hours. I came to work with migraines, a chest infection, a cold that lasted over a month, etc. I switched doctor’s offices just to have one that gave appointments in the evenings so I wouldn’t be stuck with day appointments that would require me to miss work! Now that I have paid leave, I feel so awkward and weird asking for time off for legitimate reasons. It’s not like it’s a constant thing (I think I’ve been sick 3 days – not continuous – since last summer. Left 2 hours early once for a dental appointment. Missed an afternoon to attend my university graduation. Requested a vacation day around Christmas.) but I feel like it looks bad or sketchy or somehow fake. Like, I’m not gonna haul myself to the Dr and pay $35 for a note saying that yeah, I had a migraine that day when I should just be in bed sleeping it off. 

I also am not sure how much detail to include. I feel like saying “Hello (manager), I’d like to request (time and date off) because I have a dentist appointment. Let me know if there are any issues and I can see if I can reschedule. Thank you.” Just sounds SO FAKE. Or emailing “Hello (manager), I’m feeling quite sick today so I won’t be in. Thank you.” also sounds SO FAKE!!!!!! Also because I live fairly close to my office and don’t have a long morning routine, I’m usually getting out of bed 45-60 mins before I’m to be at work… So if I wake up with a killer migraine or whatever, it won’t be until then that I realize. Again, feels very sketchy to be emailing at 645 when I’m supposed to be at work at 730. 

Also recently found out that family leave isn’t just for those employees with kiddos, but also anyone who needs to take family (incl parents) to appointments. I used to drive one of my parents to ALL their medical appointments because they don’t drive and I was good at listening to the doctors and asking questions and remembering stuff said during appointments. My other parent took over this “duty” when I started working FT but yeah I’d like to be back to doing that (occasionally!) since we have the time off and I’m better at it (lol)… But I feel so awkward emailing to ask for a day off for that sort of thing???

At my old job, I was part of a very tight-knit group (4 team members) and my supervisor was like a second mom to me. I never felt awkward asking for time off or calling in sick. Sometimes I'd show up to work sick and she'd encourage me to go home because she could tell I was just not having it. The manager I have now is a totally lovely person, but I don't work directly with her very much so 

Can anyone else relate to my neurosis??? Lol. Probably less of a public service employee thing, more just a new young employee thing, but damn.

Initially, this felt silly. I'm a young adult looking for a one-bedroom apartment. I can do that myself. I don't need help. This has to be a waste of taxpayer money. Do I really want a stranger involved in this process?

But here's what my provider did for me:

1. Spoke with me by phone to discuss my needs, budget, expectations and priorities. (How often do you walk, drive, bike, take transit? What amenities do you want close by? How much traffic and street activity can you tolerate? Are you comfortable with a rougher neighbourhood if it gets you better amenities or lower rent?)
2. Booked a bunch of appointments for me to see units. (I'm used to having to do it across multiple days, but she got them all cued up one after the other: we saw 8 places in an afternoon.)
3. Drove me around on the viewing day.
4. Did all the dirty work at the viewings. (Asked the hard questions. Tested the water pressure and the toilet flush. Inspected the appliances for age and wear. Tugged on every knob and handle in the place. Tested the electrical outlets. Haggled with the landlord when problems were present.)
5. Met with me over lunch to discuss my options and help reach a decision.
6. Reviewed the lease -- and got several concessions from my landlord. (Replace an old appliance, landlord to provide curtain rods, landlord to replace floors, landlord to allow me to hang art without impacting my security deposit...)
7. Photographed every square inch of the apartment at move-in to better cover my deposit.

I am in need of some advice trying to get bridged into the government. Last year I was working for the government on three FSWEP contracts conssecutively. One full time during the summer and the other two part time throughout the last year of my undergrad while I was finishing my Bachelors of Engineering. Problem was I had problems getting bridged. I did try to talk to my director in bridging me months before graduation but lets just say things did not work out. The manager that helped me obtain my 3 contracts retired right after she gave me my third contract. I emailed alot of managers/directors my last week of work but no one got back to me. 3 months after graduation I was succesfully hired by a private sector company that is under contract with the federal government. We work on federal government projects for the government. The role I am currently in would be the same role I would be doing with the government if I was bridged. That being said I honestly believe the government has more oppurtunity to do amazing work and all sorts of positions for career development. As well the private sector is all about money money money and never about the quality of work like the public sector. But I have learned alot working in the private sector and am more confident in what I am doing. 

I am wondering is there any way of still being able to bridge into the government? I believe i have a year and a half left to be bridged. I have applied internally to inventories such as DND and the post secondary recruitment but am unsure if my application would get pulled since I would be looking for entry level position. As well I am looking to be bridged into an english essential position which makes it harder. Any advice would be helpfull.

I'm wondering if I've been answering the complementary question on the online applications correctly.

For example:

Question:

Do you have experience interpreting analyses, defining, and documenting requirements and recommend solutions such as technical documents, procedures, use cases?

My Answer:

Between 04/16 and 11/17, I worked at ____ as a programming analyst where my primary duties included developing applications through _____ and _____. On 05/17 our team switched from _____ to _____ and I was in charge of spearheading the transition. The challenges that I faced included learning the new software, data exporting, and setting up the server. While I was learning the software I had developed small how-to guides are some of the best practices of development and how to develop certain features that were not listed in the official guide. In addition, since the exporting features from the previous software did not exist in the newer one, I had written a program in IBM SPSS syntax that imported the raw dataset from the ______ into a .____ file that is delivered to the client. I had developed a small guide that included screenshots on how to use the program step by step. I've worked with our development team, directors and clients to progress in this transition. 

For those that have applied online with success and have experience, please let me know if my answer is sufficient and if not, what I need to change.

However, based on some research I've done, I'm not sure about certain aspects of this job.

How does the development program (CS-01 to CS-02) work in relation to promotion to CS-02. I've been told that you need to meet certain qualifications at the end of a 2-year period after 2 rotations, but received no indication of what this criteria is. Is this something that is mostly a formality or is there some sort of evaluation for this and what is this criteria?

The promotion process after CS-02 seems a bit uncertain. How difficult is to actually get promoted to CS-03 and how important is French proficiency? I understand that it varies across departments, but most CS-03 jobs seem more management rather than technical and I can imagine it would be very easy to end up in a dead-end situation if you're interested in being promoted but no one pulls you out of a pool (particularly given the sheer number of CS-02s that exist relative to CS-03s and above).

Also, what's the general consensus of the CS culture at Stats Can? I didn't work for very long and only worked for one department, but my general impression was that it was pretty laid back.

Each division is fully self-contained: they run specific facilities or provide specific functions, and don't really interact with each other. Four out of six divisions are located offsite, one in another province.

When I started here (around four months ago), we used a GCDocs Excel spreadsheet as a tasker and tracker: when work goes out, or a deadline is set, it goes into the tracker, and we then update and cross it out accordingly.

The DG is unsatisfied with this solution. In practice, we in the DGO are the only ones who really use it, which means it primarily reflects the transactional stuff which crosses our desks (approvals, submission deadlines, files to review, etc.) instead of the more strategic stuff she wants to know about. And the fact that the divisions basically aren't using it at all (or are only using on a one-way basis, looking up deadlines and docket numbers but not updating it at their end) is apparently unacceptable.

She wants us to come up with a better solution for the new year, and I'm having a lot of trouble moving beyond tinkering at the margins, especially as a lot of the more obvious improvements would make the spreadsheet more difficult to use. (Low-hanging fruit: use Data Validation to standardize certain inputs, especially of dates. But that means getting people to use a standardized date format and expecting them to use filters to pull out the information they need, which is going to piss certain people off...)

At the other extreme, my instinct is to push for us to roll out a software package like Basecamp, which would square a lot of these circles. But apart from the fact that it's not even apparent to me that we'd get approval for Basecamp, that then becomes a new platform (training! growing pains!) for which we'd get zero support from any internal partners (sorry, helpdesk can't help you), and we'd still have the major problem of trying to get the divisions to use the darn thing.

Context:
Last fall I tried my luck with the PSR campaign and managed to get into two pools for EC development programs at different departments.

I accepted the term position, but three weeks before I started (and before I had been sent a formal contract to sign) I was pulled from the ECDP pool from the other department and offered an indeterminate position, which I accepted. 

Question:
Does the fact that I took a job at a different department affect my status in the other pool I was put in? Do they know I am now employed in the PS and would subsequently not bother pulling me or would they be more inclined to now that I have some real work experience? Also, would they be aware of me bailing on the term contract at their department? It's a very big department, and it was a separate psr process? ",True,6,0,,1513338934.0,1513310134.0,2048,,6,0,0

The post started out fine until they said the following (details removed):

""Unfortunately when I graduated in [Month], [Department] didn't have an existing position in [team] to bridge me into although they had promised it to me and said that they really wanted to. They even had me fill out all the paperwork and had it sent up the ladder. It turned out there wasn't enough budget to make a new position for me which was really upsetting as I'm currently sitting on E.I. and not super happy about it.""

This is oversharing and inappropriate! The first thing that comes to mind from reading this is that: 1) The recent grad is not a strategic planner because they did not set up a backup plan; 2) The recent grad lacks discretion because they are oversharing on a public forum; and 3) The recent grad does not adapt well to negative circumstances.

This could all be untrue, but it's hard to gauge from this post, and first impressions count. So, don't do this! Getting bridged into the public service requires serious perseverance and planning. While I don't consider bridging a gift (because a competent employee worthy of bridging will contribute to the team), it's also not something that students are entitled to. 

If you find that your bridge falls through, bounce back by picking up another job (anything!!!) or volunteering if you can live with your parents for free. While doing this, continue to network with federal contacts and apply to external competitions.

 was one of the lucky ones, I was bridged into an indeterminate position, and I don’t take this for granted. I know for a fact many people helped me fight for this and put a lot of work in to help me stay. I don’t work at a call center, and I work for a management branch.  

Including my time as a student, I’ve been working in the public service for a little more than a year now.

They’ve told these things to me this since I was a student, but I was still happy because I love my co-workers, and frankly I hate hassles.

I make a lot for someone my age, but I am unsure of if I should go back to school and pursue a degree.

The main concern for me is, honestly, money. I'm still young, but I do want to have a lot in life. This will sound dumb, but from what I can tell there is more room to earn above-average salaries in the private sector than in the public sector, and that interests me greatly. I know it sounds shallow and all, but in your opinion how likely would it be to make significantly more if I pursued a degree in something like Engineering?

Something that sticks out in my mind is the raw time commitment. A degree is at least four years.. in four years of working at my current salary, that's 200k gross. Even if, in four years, I managed to get a job making 70k vs the 50k I make now, it would take 10 years to make up that 200k ""lifetime earnings boost"" given by working rather than attending an educational institution. That's also assuming that my salary stays the same for the next 4 years at least, and wouldn't improve in those following 4 years either. 

On top of my above example, I would likely end up in debt ~40K for student loans. Which means that I would be looking at at least 12 years to break even, I'll be 35 at that point. I could invest a portion of my earnings for the next 4 years, and it would make it taken even longer to ""break even"" with a degree.

I'm young, and my opinion is skewed. I just read a lot recently about public service jobs having a low ceiling, without much room for significant pay advancement. But I mean, how much can I really earn living in the Atlantic region? Even with a degree, I can't imagine it's much higher than 60-70k without starting a business.

0,7ge2t7,t5_3f8vd,Help understanding Leave Balances in My GCHR,4,personalfinance21,,,False,False,t3_7ge2t7,False,False,False,"I’m relatively new to the public service (2 years) and have now only been given access to PeopleSoft/Phoenix and MyGCHR. I checked my leave balances which I am having troubles understanding and interpreting. 

Basically my leave balances read as follows:

Sick 
     - carry over 196.875
     - advanced/earned 65.625
     - balance total of 262.5

Vacation 
     - carry over 196.875
     - advance/earned 112.5
     - balance total of 309.375

I’m less concerned about sick days, more so my vacation balance. Does this mean my vacation balance is 8 weeks (309.375 / 37.5)? That doesn’t seem right to me. Perhaps my first 2 years earned 6 weeks and I have already earned my 3 weeks for year three? I haven’t taken much vacation but this doesn’t seem to add up. 

Hope some of you help help explain. 

Is there a useful CSPS course about MyGCHR or a person I can chat with?

Thanks!

TLDR; I'm in my mid-late 20s after being bridged, several years in public service straight out of university.

Turns out I could have, and probably should have.  Once the C/Ms are deemed to the PS, the pensions will be ported over and assuming your start date is kosher, your pension will be considered as Category 1 - that is, under the old rules..  Because I am a new employee, I am Cat. 2, and will need to work an additional 5 years before I can think of early retirement.  As I have no proof to back up my claim, the pension center can't review my case and change things around.

0,7fp7n9,t5_3f8vd,Phoenix: No one listened,60,TweedieCampaign,Union / Syndicat,,False,False,t3_7fp7n9,False,False,False,"You know me as user ""TweedieCampaign"" but in real life, my name is Randy Legault; husband of Jacky Tweedie; parent to six kids; brother; uncle and, not least, the son of a WWII veteran who had the great good fortune to marry my mother - a public service compensation specialist, Glady Legault.

My mom worked every day of her long career giving of herself to help members of the RCMP get the pay and benefits they signed on for. Giving and helping were in Gladys' nature. Her only regret about her chosen career was that she had not been a nurse, a profession dedicated to comforting the afflicted and saving lives.  But through her diligent service she absolutely comforted the afflicted, day by day, year after year for the better part of a lifetime.  

Phoenix has shown us how intimately the details of our compensation can effect us as human beings. My mother was not just a ""calculator."" She cared personally for each of the individuals that she was helping, whether it be correcting the odd pay error or ensuring that a member disabled in the line of duty got the right long term support they paid for through their deductions. Mostly it was less dramatic, but in each and every case, someone either needed expert advice (and got it) or assistance to be made whole. Gladys Legault helped people.  It's what a compensation advisor is meant to do. 

She died recently, at the age of 84 after a long illness. Not, however, before receiving a letter, on her deathbed, asking her to consider returning to public service.  People need help -- and I'll tell you, if she were up for it, she would have answered the call.

If you are or know someone in the helping professions, you know that empathy takes a toll.  I can only imagine the strain on those who remain in the trenches trying to sort out the Phoenix mess that, if you'd asked them, they could have predicted.  But I expect no one asked and, when told by those compensation advisors, we know no-one listened.

So this goes out to all the compensation advisors -- the unseen victims of Phoenix who live to serve, and daily absorb the toll of this avoidable tragedy.",True,6,0,,1511754191.0,1511725391.0,2048,,60,0,0
